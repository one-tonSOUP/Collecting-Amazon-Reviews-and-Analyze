    "Review": "I didn't knew the issue that this phone has Fogg issues in its camera and I bought it blindly. But when i watched some YouTube videos and read some reviews on Amazon about how people are facing Fogg issues in its camera, i immediately turned on my camera and started shooting videos, and guess what?? It only took 2 minutes and a few seconds and the camera was all fogged up. This is not at all acceptable from a company charging 55000rs for a phone. I have submitted a request for exchange and i'll edit my review as soon as i get my solution on this Fogg machine.",
