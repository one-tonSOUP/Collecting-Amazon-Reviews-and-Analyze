    "Review": "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Jan 6th:-Yet to get any security patch after Sep 2022!.. It has been 4 months since now.. I'm disappointed frankly in terms of updates.. I understand that the phone is due & should be amongst 1st to get Android 13 based MiUI 14 to arrive anytime now.. But that is not an excuse to not provide this long!.. I expected a Dec 2022 update atleast by now..In terms of battery there has been a decline in backup esp when on mobile data.. Thanks to 5G network now.. For whatever reason the auto brightness of the phone is continuously very high than what is required (adding to average battery performance).. There has been a few stutters in the UI I'm noticing which could be again related to lack of updates!.. Also I notice very aggressive RAM management performance where certain apps get killed immediately as soon as I get out of it!.. Possibly it's got to do with MiUI's irritating battery saving attempt..Anyways hoping for some improvements in my next update.. Fingers crossed..Nov 27th:-Got my vodafone primary sim ported to Airtel & have Jio as my secondary sim.. Both are giving me 5g internet with Jio giving consistently more 5g connectivity than Airtel. The Phone is blazing fast now in terms of browsing & YouTube etc.. Attaching some screen for 5g performance of the phone!..Oct 19th:-Got an update to enable 5g services for the phone. Under settings though I don't see any changes.Had been to Kashmir vacation where the phone was used fully.. The battery loss was quiet significant outdoors on mobile data with 2 sim cards.. The main reason for it is it's display that's almost at full brightness in auto mode.. Also due to poor signals in Kashmir, the phone is continously working to look for a stable mobile network.. The photos came out fantastic for it's segment & I was comparing it against iPhone 13 Mini/ iPhone 12 Pro/ iPhone 12/ S20 FE 5G of my cousins.. A lot of times my cousins preferred me to take the main cam shots from Xiaomi 12 Pro over others!.. The selfie performance was average at best though.. The telephoto/ zoom performance was toe to toe with iPhone 12 Pro in both photos & videos!!.. Coming to the most controversial video shooting performance, most of the videos ranging from 30 secs to nearly 10 mins in the most unique HDR10+ quality came out fabulous!!.. The video quality was not comparable to iPhone 12 Pro/ 13 as soon as the natural lights came down though.. The iPhones showed their superiority clearly in low light/ sunset videos..Will keep updating my experience further as days go..Oct 9th:-Have got September security patch. The routine is one security patch every 2-3 months typical of Xiaomi.. The update had nothing else other than security patch in it..The phone is otherwise performing same n is top notch & Im extremely happy with the device..Sep 17th:-Performance of the phone has improved now!.. Xiaomi has done some magic.. Even the phones highest cpu temperature against any load is only 60 degrees as against 75 degrees before!Attaching new benchmark app results..Aug 29th:-Attaching some screenshots from my phone for all the battery life cribbers & potential customers & interested fellows..I got a Screen On Time (SOT) of over 7:30 hours today!!!.. See for yourself before judging the battery life of Xiaomi 12 Pro.. I have also attached a set of screenshots from my phone settings that affect battery life..Always give time to your phone & the advanced AI in it to start reading what kind of user it is working with!.. My phone is 20+ days old now & it has learnt how I use my phone & how to optimise it.. So dont jump to conclusions by looking at your phone in hours!!..My phone today was used indoors mainly with mostly on Wifi but has 2 SIMs in it.. Bluetooth on for occasional smartphone connectivity & other settings in the screenshot.. Also reiterating that the phone has very good standby battery time too even with Always On Display..Aug 25th:-Attaching 4K@60fps video of 2 mins length.. I tried attaching 5 mins video I shot but Amazon says the file is too big to be attached!.. So I can't upload the 5 mins video.. What I can confirm though is no camera fogging visible anymore in the rear sensor.. Nor is the video shootage (both videos) had any fogging visible at all!!.. Remember we are talking about a phone that had it originally..After 5+2 mins of 4K@60fps, the phone was warm.. The battery temperature showed 45 degrees max.. Just FYI..Aug 24th:-I see a lot of customers are unhappy with the phone after purchasing as there is fog in the rear camera. They rate the phone 1 star & want to return it.. It's their wish as it's their product/ money..But I had a suggestion to kind off resolve this issue as I have done for my phone.. I made 2 videos today to test the situation.. 5 mins 4K@60fps videos each from the main rear sensor.. I had no fogging issues to note!!.. Just to remind the readers, my phone also had camera fogging issue while shooting videos from the main cam in the past (have made a note of it in my review below for reference)..So what did I do to resolve the issue.. Just shoot 5 mins length 4K@60fps videos from the main camera.. Shoot 10 videos back to back of 5 mins length in the same resolution.. The phone will heat up badly.. Let it heat up.. Once done shooting 10 videos.. Come out of the camera app & leave the phone to cool down.. Don't bother shooting a video to test anymore.. Give it 1 days time & meanwhile use your phone normally for any other function.. Test the video the next day & check whether the issue persists.. If it still does, you can return the product.. Otherwise all well & good.. I lost both 5 mins videos I shot this evening.. I will update a 5 mins video in a day or 2 for you to see the video quality yourself n whether there's any foggy tone in the video..Aug 20th:-Bought Xiaomi 12 Pro for 50K on Aug 7th in sale after card & coupon discounts.. Below is my experience so far in these 12 days;-Like to start with the display which is the best part about the phone.. This is one of the best ever screens on any smartphone ever!!.. A curved display that is 6.73\" E5 Amoled that is 120hz, LTPO 2, 10 Bit, QHD+, Dolby Vision, with 1050 nits max brightness (gsmarena tested) screen.. That has wonderful viewing angles, absolutely stunning hardware with no screen leak or dirty screen effects like it's competitors' inconsistent/ poor QCd units!.. Absolute \u2764.. A few cons that I noticed though is the phone has more accidental touch issue due to curved screen than say my previous phones iQOO 9Pro & Samsung Note20Ultra.. Also the phone doesn't come with a pre applied screen protector.. Had to get a good quality screen protector for 1000 rupees..Nextly the speakers & audio quality.. It's got Harmon Kardon tuned quad speakers (2 woofers + 2 tweeters), with 2 dedicated outlets, that is excellent.. Yes, it's not the loudest esp when compared to iphones & Samsung flagships & Oneplus flagships.. But the quad speakers show their speciality with a full range of sound & with it's richness during any kind of audio output.. Compared the audio with my wife's iPhone 12 (as good as any iphone 13 series) & that's where I make these observations.. Also I've owned Samsung flagships in the past to add on to the experience..Design & Build wise.. the phone is of the highest order possible with excellent design & color options along with a solid/ very stylish metal frame that syncs with Gorilla Glass Victus display on the front & Gorilla Glass 5 glass on the hind.. The bezels in the top & bottom isn't the snallest of all though n the curve at the edges could be more boxy for my liking than the current design that's more roundish.. All in all the phone syncs overall with the Purple hue beautifully to make it a piece of art!.. The only sore miss is an IP68 rating sadly..MiUi 13 on the phone is running July 2022 security update & the UI is polished & has excellent animations n look n feel!.. I have used phones with One UI, Color OS, Realme UI, Funtouch OS, iOS, Stock Androids (never used Oxygen OS though).. My most favorite UI for style n look n animations & feel has to be MiUI amongst all!.. The sheer array of Wallpapers (incl free Live Wallpapers), Themes, Fonts that's available for free is unbelievably good n incomparable!!.. The way the haptics have been integrated into the UI is best of all to add on.. The haptic motor is amongst the best too!.. All is not roses for MiUI though with slightly lower stability in terms of smoothness & consistency when compared to Color OS & One UI which are butter smooth.. The battery & general optimization is very well done though.. There were about 5-6 unwanted apps out of the box but most were straight uninstall while a few others I could remove using the adb function.. Overall very happy with the software experience so far.. Also adding on is a promise of 3 Major Android  updates until Android 15 & security patches for 4 years!.. What is to be noted is Xiaomi doesn't provide prompt monthly updates.. It is only periodic like say once in 2 to 4 months which is not great..Call quality over ear piece & mic & speaker is excellent.. The signal reception for sim card of various vendors - Vodafone/ Airtel/ Jio is all fine with very rare issues (I blame it to poor service than phone).. Wifi performance is fabulous with the best mobile modem attached to Snapdragon 8Gen1.. Bluetooth connectivity, NFC n all other modes of connectivity are top notch.. So very happy with these most primary functions on any phone..Cameras wise the highlight is the primary rear custom made 50MP sensor Sony IMX707 which is fantastic in literally every condition for photography!.. It has 1 big issue that has to be addressed though.. The rear primary camera fogging while shooting video for anything more than 1.5 mins.. But this rear camera fogging isn't consistent & sometimes it doesnt do it n fine too inbetween!.. But it's inconsistent for it's unpredictable performance.. The Ultrawide & Telephoto/ Portrait cameras consist of 2 50MP Samsung JN1 sensors respectively.. This is an excellent setup & they work very well for most functions.. The Telephoto/ Portrait cam has only 2X Optical zoom but that's a good enough feature with sharp & pleasing zoom pics.. The Telephoto cam lacks OIS which is a miss according to me & wouldve helped in low light zoom.. Similarly the Ultrawide cam lacks Autofocus & that doesn't make it a Macro cam which is sad.. All 3 rear cams can shoot good quality 4K@60fps videos with excellent stability!.. The night time photo/ video shooting is also top notch thanks to excellent implementation of bright flash with good flash timing & length to assist.. Overall very capable rear cameras.. Selfie cam wise it's a 32MP Omnivision sensor which isn't great hardware wise.. I would've wished a top Sony sensor instead.. The dynamic range of the selfie is very limited.. The phone takes a full 32MP snap & isn't pixel binned yet the sharpness isn't great n the photos come out slightly soft.. Yet Xiaomi's excellent post processing capabilities make the selfie cam Above Average overall for stills.. Night mode in selfie helps brighten the screen for additional light while autofocus assistance by the AI system for selfie helps a great deal overall.. Selfie video shooting is capped at 1080p@60fps resolution at max but has very good stability due to EIS.. Overall a very good camera experience considering I'm not too much of a video shooter..Battery backup has been good.. Yes I'm saying good unlike many in this forum.. The users should understand that the phone has an SOC thats amongst the fastest & more powerful on the planet n a sportscar can never give you a commuter car's fuel efficiency!.. Well apart from this logic have attached a couple of screenshots where I have easily recorded over 6hrs of Screen On Time!.. This is with always only at 120hz + QHD+ + Other visual enhancement settings + Always on display all the time + Live Wallpaper + high haptics but with only dark mode & Auto brightness enabled (Auto brightness is generally on high brightness most of the times).. The phone has excellent idle time battery optimization thanks to MiUI.. The 120 watts charger tops up the phone in quick time but has a USB Type A to Type C connectors.. It isn't say as fast charging as iQOO 9 Pro's more mordern Type C to Type C port that charges more faster.. Finally the heating aspect of the phone.. Please note that amongst the Snapdragon 8Gen1 phones like - Samsung S22 series, OnePlus 10Pro, iQOO 9Pro, Realme GT2 etc.. Only Xiaomi 12 Pro has unrestricted 8Gen1 speed (ie not downclocking the chipset in the fear of overheating).. The phone consistently scores above 9 lacs in Antutu with CPU score of over 2 lacs no matter any condition unlike all of it's competitors!.. The others have downclocked their chipsets to control overheating.. What this means is Yes the chipset is notorious for overheating when stressed.. I have seen a max of 75 degrees celcius of CPU & 50 degrees of battery Temperature when pushed to it's extreme in Antutu test.. Also when I shot multiple 4K videos of 5 mins length for more than 30 mins at a stretch, got a message saying the phone has overheated & give it a break.. So yes the phone has overheating issue but again only when pushed to heavy duty.. Otherwise for regular operation it is fine.. Runs at a CPU temperature ranging from 40 to 50 degrees & battery from 32 to 42 degrees which is normal..The fingerprint sensor is a regular optical unit.. It is nowhere near as fascinating/ secure/ fast as iQOO 9 Pro's 3D Ultrasonic unit that's just the best ever!..On the whole at 50K there cannot be a better smartphone than this ever!.. Really happy with the phone also considering it's cons..I whole heartedly recommend this phone to all until you are a frequent video shooter & a gamer (overheating issue)..",

    "Comment": "Almost a flagship, but with lot of sacrifices and issues",
    "Review": "The ratings i gave are considering other flagship phones in nearby price range from competitorsj(OnePlus/Samsung/Oppo/Vivo/Realme/Motorola/Apple/Pixel/Asus)!Battery drain is very significant even when idle, didn't expect it in a flagship. (Looses 8-15% at night, when always on display is off, vibration is off, mobile data/WiFi is off)[Update September 2022: With latest software updates, battery drain when idle seems to have resolved to some extent. Also, there is no performance sacrifices for this. So, now I wouldn't consider battery drain a huge negative point, as the charging is really fast]Also, even for for just casual usages there is slight heating issue, when outside temperature is 30-33\u00b0C (an average temperature in India; For those in cold places, there are issues too... keep reading!)On gaming, it throttles a lot along with overheating at times, maybe given performance equivalent to Snapdragon 855 or 845, when heated up! Maybe going with Mi 11 Ultra would be a better choice, or go for 8Gen1 devices from other companies or wait for 8Gen1+! I really regret the decision to buy this phone, been using it for 1 week now!!!I have been using Xiaomi products for many years, and decided to believe and buy a flagship from this company. But so far the experience is disappointing, and gives a midrange feel in many areas... Over heating when used outside, for just regular usages, like Gmail, browsing the internet, Amazon etc... Also, though the charging is fast, the battery drain is fast too...And the camera needs a lot of optimization. Daylight photos, many times it's over exposed and over saturated and cases can be reddish. And HDR doesn't always work well. Its sometimes a disappointing performance, considering its supposed to be a flagship camera! Even that can be fixed by a software update...And maybe a good Gcam port is all I can hope for, if someone makes it, as i don't have much hope from Xiaomi... But surely there are hardware issues too...Overheating is surely somewhat an hardware issue, given the negative feedback of 8Gen1...But the implementation in Mi 12 pro, seems so poor, and it makes things worse. It's advertising industry leading cooling systems, but performance isn't reflecting it!Also, i recently went to a hill station(temperature was 13-20\u00b0C) and on trying the camera there, the phone heats up even there on using camera for few minutes, and fog got formed in the internal camera lens of the main camera unit, which is quite disappointing!  (Note: it's not outside the camera, that it can be wiped, but inside the camera.And saw in online forums and YouTube that it's a general issue with this model, especially the Chinese and Indian ones! Search and you can find the issue)Hope the device doesn't get under-clocked, because I and most people who opt for a flagship care about high end performance.So Xiaomi, if you are reading this, we all hope, an alternative fix for overheating can be implemented with software that doesn't involve sacrificing the performance of 8Gen1! I will wait and see how Xiaomi takes feedback and fixes these issues(I have filled feedback using the feature provided within the phone)...I am not even sure if customer feedback is even considered and I am doubting the trust and decision of buying a premium phone from Xiaomi...On a positive note, the screen is excellent, main camera module is great in low light (though there are hiccups at times), also zoom camera isn't great, given its a 2x telephoto!The IR blaster, is a nice to have. Also it checks most of the features that is expected in a flagship. But it doesn't have an official IP rating, though they say its built to be IP 53 compliant. But flagships should be having IP 68.Performance is smooth, which is expected, but there are software glitches at times, and the issue of overheating and battery drain! As the battery keeps draining fast, and if we keep charging with 120W, battery life is a question... Don't think it will last much long!The charger is insane, but heavy and not very travel friendly....  And claimed charging speed of 18 mins isn't achievable unless phone doesn't heat up, which isn't possible unless you give it active cooling while charging!Realistically you get from 0-100% in 25-30 mins!",

    "Review": "1. Look & Feel: 10/10. Good look device with amazing built quality. No doubt a flagship experience.2. Display: 10/10. Amazing display with 144 hz refresh rate and really bright. Easily beats iphone 14 and hold its own ground against even S22 ultra! This is as good as it gets. Although if I have to nit-pick, the auto brightness does screw up sometimes and you will have to manually adjust the brightness for best viewing experience. Also make sure you go into setting and select 2k & 144 hz resolution. The system default out of the box is FHD+ only. I am pretty sure it\u2019s made to save battery. onscreen fingerprint reader is reliable & works well.3. Camera: 8/10. Camera is great for most part. I have observed it works best in 4:3 aspect ratio. I like my photos to fill the screen. In 16:9 or higher aspect ratio, many a times there is fish eye effect as well some blur on the edges. If you want to compare it to the true flagships, it definitely cannot compete. But it is still one of the best cameras out there.4. Battery Life: 6/10. Battery life is average at best. 5 hours screen on time with about 13 hours runtime is the best you can expect.5. SOC: 5/10. This phone has heating issues if you are a gamer or heavy user. Normal usage, heating is not an issue. Snapdragon 8 gen 1 definitely is a big hit & miss. Do not buy this phone if you are looking for heavy usage and gaming.6. Software: 6/10. For most part the software is great. But with long term usage you will start noticing:a. Bloatware! Too many unnecessary apps, some you cannot even uninstall. The \u2018Get app\u2019 app store which is a system app and cannot be uninstalled keeps pushing you to install more bloatware!!b. Most widgets cannot be resized. Resizing widget is almost common sense now a days in android phones, cannot believe they have botched this up in this phone!c. Some high-end features like converting youtube videos into 2k in real time doesn\u2019t work and many such features are just gimmicks at best.7. Keyboard: 5/10. There is some good haptic feedback while typing, but that is where the goodness ends. The autocorrect is downright horrible and I found typing is not that fast!8. Network: 5/10. If you are city dweller, you wouldn\u2019t find this aspect as lacking. But if you are in hard-to-reach network places, I found this device quite lacking. In many places in my home where I used to get full network in my old phone, I get only 2 bars in this. And at the slightest hint of low network, it completely goes out of network.",

    "Review": "Overall it's a good quality phone. The outer layer of the box came in wet wich some oil/moisture all over the box. But i guess it didn't affect the phone.  I have been using it for over a week. The battery could have lasted a little longer but the fast charging makes up for it. Some apps especially the unpopular ones tend to crash here and there with MIUI which users must note. My biggest issue is when i record videos at 1080p at 30 or 60 fps, and i send it over WhatsApp...the video gets compressed so much that it's laggy and unwatchable. Overall ..I'm happy with the product",

Cameras are just awesome not as other phones like a cameras count. Triple cameras which is really worth. Primary, Ultra wide and mainly Telephoto triple 50MP as well as 32MP selfie. Charging speed really awesome but battery is average. Because for a day am charging twice. Sound quality this time am totally impressed.

    "Comment": "Its a beautiful BEAST which needs some hardware fixing by XAIOMI",
    "Review": "Guys you would not need to read any other review after this one. I will sum it up very clearly.This phone is a BEAST! I have only rated it 3 stars because of xaiomi not taking care of their best phone in the market, even i had to return it as well due to reasons I will mention below. I ordered this phone via an exchange of an old phone with broken screen in the sale which made this phone cost me around 35k which was a decent price since I always buy phones from 20k to 35k. The moment I received the mobile i was gone crazy. The way it looked was awesome, the way it felt in the hand was great, very premium! Massive 120 watt charging in just 20 mins was so lovely. I have used Lenovo,Vivo,poco, samsung,one plus but this one is the most wonderful looking phone I have ever held. Screen so responsive that even iPhone seems it's child. Camera so fantastic that i fell in love with the first video i recorded with it. potrait shot is whole new level. Great stabilization in the camera and speakers in the phone is just a cherry on top of the cake. Apart from this AI features to add a crisp on your video experience. Back camera is the just amazing but the front is just ok in comparison with the back one but does good enough. Now why did i only give it 3 stars and returned it. Well reason was that it had a minor issue of heating too much and battery draining quickly which was a little wears because I wasn't using the device heavily. I am very use to using mobiles and I know how fastly does a phone battery drain based on the usage but the the unit I got was draining unnecessarily but apart from battery everything else was a charm mind it guys so I ordered a replacement later, the next unit i received was a nightmare because this time I was having issues with the camera but not with the battery. The battery this time was draining according to my usage. Since it has tones of features supporting the next level amoled display so battery consumption was similar to that and I was pretty much ok with this device because it has a massive 120 wt charging which in 20 mins charged the phone from 20 to 100. So who cares if you get to charge your phone twice a day.But this unit has serious issues with the back camera. Fogs accumulated everytime I used the phone to make videos. This was irritating so I had to return it again. Remember friends the first unit i received had a battery issue and the second i received had a camera issue which means xaiomi is not taking care of the phone manufacturing up to the mark. The phone is excellent only if anyone gets the right unit.Now who should buy it?The one who has a good amount of savings with himself who can just buy a phone with a flaw or two, doesn't care if the unit had a battery issue or like that. I would have kept the phone avoiding the battery issue in the first unit since it can be charged in 15 minutes if i had good savings which I don't \ud83d\ude02 so I had to return it.If someone wants to know more about this phone he can mail me his queries at shashankkshekharr1990@gmail.com. i will happily clear any doubts.",

Could not buy another option because of this issue and jo one in Amazon also knows the same. Go for it if you get a good exchange value. As this is a top line phone so what to write. Just need to use it for some time for proper battery backup information.",

    "Comment": "Brilliant phone crippled down by heating",
    "Review": "Been using this phone for 7 days now. My review during this breif period are as below:1. Display: The best out there. Nothing can get better than QHD+, 2K, 120Hz LTPO, Dolby vision, HDR10+ display. Its vibrant however the QHD+ drains more battery. FHD+ resolution isn't bad either. So I have set for FHD+ and during OTT consumption I change to QHD+.2. Speakers: Tuned by Harman Kardon, it's not the loudest but the quality of the output is great. You can feel the difference when paired with any earphones.3. Processor: The hottest processor by Qualcomm \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01. Made by Samsung, this processor has turned the fortunes of Qualcomm. Since the performance is not tuned down, so the processor tends to get warm with normal usage and hot with heavy usage. Xiaomi need to push OTA to limit the processor otherwise we can cook omlette on this during summers.4. Cameras: Triple 50MP set up delivers exceptionally well photos. Many people are getting fog issue in the camera. I haven't got this. I have tried recording 4k @30 and 60fps and 8k @24fps both in indoors as well as outdoors. No such issue found. Selfie is least used in my phone so can't really comment on that.5. Software: I have been using MiUI since 2018 and I really adapt to the UI of any phone. As Xiaomi has promised 3 yrs of Android update and 4 yrs of security updates so the phone will go till Android 15. That's a good sign.6. Charger: The 120W charger is heavy. But I have not used boost charger. I use normal charging which is quite fast. Also I use 22.5W mi charger for better battery life.7. Battery life: First it was giving around 5hrs of SOT. Then it increased to 7hrs. Actually the phone is adapting itself. So the SOT will increase after few usage. Also I'm using this as my secondary phone as of now.8. Finger print is slow. And I think the area for fingerprint is also bit smaller.Bought this after exchanging my favourite Redmi K20 pro @37000. At that price I felt I should give it a try. Earlier thought of Samsung S22+ but my budget was upto 50k. So I could not stretch myself upto that. Will update more when I use the phone extensively.",

    "Comment": "Really great phone at 43K",
    "Review": "Ok I am giving this review about the phone after my normal day to day use of 20+ days.1st of all let's talk about the FOG issue. My unit had a FOG issue when it arrived and some people said that updating it to latest MIUI 13.0.9 is fixing the FOG issue but it didn't happen on my phone. After 8 days I switched to EU ROM and the fog issue is not there anymore. Created 15 mins. 4K 60 FPS video without any issue. But the FOG issue is a hardware problem so changing a rom simply eliminating the problem is completely out of my mind and some people also said that their fog issue disappeared after updating to official 13.0.9 so I guess the Fog issue will disappear automatically once you use your phone for 10+ days. That's when Mine went away and I used the camera only 2 times for creating 4k 60 fps videos of 3-4 mins. for ofcourse fog issue testing purposes.Now the Battery life: Screenshot is given with this review about how is this phone's battery life on daily basis with normal usage and No gaming sessions on EU ROM which is normal for this kind of flagship phones.Heating Issue: I never encountered any heating issues with my phone on official 13.0.9. Same goes with EU rom. ialways sit below or on 30\u00b0 CUntil a better official update comes, this phone is strictly for those who knows how to flash a rom and can spare some time on customising their phone. If you are a guy who only sticks with official updates and roms then stay away for now.",

    "Comment": "over-heating issue after 2 months usage",
    "Review": "[---- changed my review to 1 star because after using this device for 2 months , its heating too much even in normal usage and very low display settings.i set it to fhd only and refresh rate 60hz only. still temperature reaches 40 degree in normal usage . my previous device had sd865, and compare to that this feels a downgrade solely because of the overheating issue. all other things are great no doubt but what good they do if i am not able to hold the mobile on my palm for more than 5 minutes. tried many solutions like resetting , debloating . none helpful so far. xiaomi should release a software fix for this issue. but they are busy launching new devices to sell but no long term support even in flagship devices . disappointing  ----]i mainly bought the device because of the value for money and most importantly the display . the display is top notch. here are some things that i noticed.#1.  the wqhd 2k display is totally worth it , colors are sharp , clarity is excellent , dolby visions further optmizes the video and images. dolby vision gives you feeling of watching movies on big tv screen . you have to enable it for every app , filter style hdr . but cant find any good tempered glass in the market for this device. that fits ut correctly#2.  camera produces very good colors  . i have used other flagships and its much better than anything i have seen so far first hand. rest you can see in attached images. although camera isn't my priority but i know when i see a good camera.#3.  heating is what i was worried about but it even heats less than my older device with sd865 .  here it is hot climate these days . but for normal usage its battery remained within 38-42 degree celcius . cpu too ranges between 38 to 45 depending on your usage . ambient temperature is important factor here . i did not do gaming as of now , but will update later in this review after playing BGMI . also the device cools faster than any other device that i have used . [ edit : i played BGMI and very smooth experience . you do neeed to tweak some graphic settings though. 90hz rfresh rate is sufficient for this game , did not feel it heating more than the ordinary, do not play games while charging this device i suggest ]#4. speed and productivity is super smooth . sd 8 gen 1 is worth it . all apps open so smoothly . i found big difference in compare to my previous device mi 10t pro  which has sd865 .  if i had to guess it is almost 100% jump in terms of speed and performance.#6. dolby atmos is good , increases sound quality#7. battery backup is i guess normal . i don't feel much difference Between sd865 and sd 8 gen 1 battery consumption. if you want your battery SOT longer . do not use charging boost feature. battery -backup will increase then.#8. miui 13 is good optmized in this device in  compare to miui 12.5 that i used to have in my older device  .#9. indisplay fingerprint scanner is not that fast i think it needs further software optimisations. it gives warning of \"only use compatible screen protector\" , but do not provide any information where i can  find that  . i am yet to receive tempered glass that i ordered , i will update once i apply that and see if fingerprint sensor still works after applying or not  .#10. there is no pre- applied screen protector#11. silicon back case cover that comes with it... is really really good.  perfectly designed.#12. design is good . doesnt feel bulky . weight distribution is really nicely done.#13.  opera Mauve color seems good that i bought, but i did expect better#14. the back part i dont know if it is gorilla glass or something else . but it feels different. may be its scratch resistant or not i have no idea . but its definitely dust resistant.overall excellent flagship . i got 12 gb 256gb version for only 57k after discount. worth it.i bought this device after comparing it with other sd 8 gen 1 , found this one good on paper so chose it . now i can say it is as good as in reality too .i will update the review if i face any issues ,Note- for temperature monitor use 'cpu monitor' app it shows overall cpu temperature and not just of one core.",

    "Comment": "Feedback on MIUI",
    "Review": "I used to own Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro purchased in USA before this one. The camera quality was okay but not anywhere comparable with the flagship phone's quality. But I really liked MIUI (12.5 I suppose) and hence went for another Xiaomi model as an upgrade.It was a surprise when I found that MIUI 13 chose to use Google apps for Phone, Contacts and SMS. There is no equivalent Xiaomi app available on Play Store that supports its new phone models. I dislike all these three Google apps because of its choice of funky Google Sans font and lack of features. Also, I find the text used throughout the phone is less consistent in terms of font-size and line spacing.Another small feedback I want to add is something that I think should be fixable by Xiaomi through a software update. When I use Xiaomi 12 Pro in a room illuminated with warm light such as incandescent bulb, the phone screen suddenly goes dark, as if the auto-brightness setting only has sensitivity to blue lights. Because of this, I need to manually bring up the screen brightness once every day. I am not sure how to channel this feedback directly to Xiaomi and check if this issue affects many users in case there is a user forum watched by Xiaomi.Do not misunderstand my review as purely negative. MIUI 13 brings host of quality-of-life features and the positives outweigh the negatives, but I think that somewhere they have loosen the grip on consistency and aesthetics on the way of adding new features.",

    "Review": "Absolutely Stunning !!!This review is for those who are still doubtful to buy or not.This is going to be a long review so take a moment to read if whish to.Overall: This is an amazing device packed with all top notch features that anyone looks before buying.I have waited for almost 8 months to buy this and was extremely confused with the reviews complaining about Heating issues (majorly), camera etc etc etc.None basically. This is a beast phone.Design \u2013 So aesthetic, feels premium, the heft in hand weight balance is so balanced that makes it a perfect in hand feeling.Display: Gorgeous. As simple as that.Call Quality \u2013 absolutely perfect.Call reception \u2013 sometimes I see network reception is less but calls comes and goes. Sometime I have see calls drops also but that is difficult to say is because of handset.Media / Sound \u2013 Pleasure. Right balance.Camera \u2013 perfect light \u2013 difficult to beat, low light, a bit of struggle. Front camera \u2013 satisfying images.Battery \u2013 Less ofcouse, as it is packed with features which consumes battery. At the same time gives very powerful charger hence can\u2019t be complained.Performance \u2013 If you are media consumer, emails, texts, banking, documents, and everything that does not include gaming \u2013 difficult to beat this device.Gaming \u2013 I never play games on phone.Heating \u2013 Yes, very very acceptable. The processor itself is like this. But only when use Camera for long, use phone over Mobile data only.Verdict \u2013 just go for it. It will not disappoint.",

    "Review": "I bought this product at Rs. 35290/- valued at 58,999/- with all discounts and EMI during festive sale season in September'22.Product was delivered on 5th October, Amazon bag was open condition and no invoice inside but mobile box was intact. Delivery was done late at night even though promised to deliver in Afternoon. Maybe, too many deliveries during festive season.Product is good, fast processor, battery lasts longer time, charging 10% to 100% within 15 minutes, fast charging. However some basic features missing in Mi like adjusting apps in alphabetical order, contacts by scanning a visiting card, etc... These are basic features which are available in a low value vivo, realme, or oppo phone.Mi needs to improve basic functionality related features on their platform so users life becomes easier.I will give 4 out of 5 as I am unsatisfied with basic features only.Technicallly phone is good.Heats up at charging but that's normal for fast charging phones.",

Slow motion---fogggggggingBut fog disappeared after 2-3 minutes.Night photos are not that great.We can record videos in 4k 60 fps in ultra wide and in telephoto mode...fog is not gonna appear...Because we didn't stress the main camera... finally we can some how record the video 4k 60 fps....HDR+ feature didn't work in ultra wide and telephoto mode...................................................Display is one of the most beautiful thing in this phone. Amazing curved screen guys.... excellent mind blowing....Speaker are not that much powerful...Average speakers....Don't expect too much from them...Gaming is decent...Charging is blazing fast...Didn't notice any bugs ...No laggingI didn't do video recording regularly..so decided to keep the phone with me rather than returning it back....Apart from camera (video recording issue)Phone is beast....",

Overall it's 8/10 but fogging issue soo it comes down to a 3/10 as Overall Experience- Front camera is good 7/10- Great Haptic feedback 8/10- Already poor battery life then 5G is around the corner after 5G more bad battery performance \ud83d\ude05 though it has All the 5G bands Required \ud83d\udc4d 5/10 for battery- Average Wi-Fi!!!! I was shocked to see the lack of Speed/Stability with it's Wi-Fi maybe problem in my unit or the Latest Update problem but it's just Sad to witness this in a Flagship device. 6/10-Network Reception is good and calling is better experience. 9/10 for Network reception and great mic \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f- it's heavy \ud83d\ude36 atleast to me and my friends it felt Heavy and uneasy weighing around 200Grams. 4/10 for bad experience \ud83d\ude36- Not IP Certified for such Costliest Mi device is another Disappointment for many Consumers but felt doable for my case- it gets Warm in normal tasks and gets Hot after Playing graphic intensive games like COD, Genshin impact etc. 4/10 for thermal management.Who Should be getting this ? If you're okay with the average battery life and patience required for Camera fogging problem then only opt for it, that being said Overall it's a Great device Obviously but the MiUi keeps taking Toll on it's Performance now and then so more Patience required \ud83d\ude02 Sorry Mi I had to share the Reality of how amazing the phone is! but also the few problems it comes with.Thank you for Reading New Age Consumers \ud83d\ude03",

Wirless audio is good.Pros: 1. Awesome LTPO AMOLED 2k Display2. Good wirless audio on headphones and earphones.3. Good build.4. 5G Ready5. Charger is awesome. I was able to fully charge in 25 mins.6. Haptic feedback is above average, if not the best.Cons:1. Poor quality audio on quad speakers.2. Mediocre camera set up. Both videography and photography is poor.3. No Macro photography for this price is a blummer ( it is there on redmi note 10 and not on flagship).4. 2x Telephoto lens is literally useless. Niether portrait photos nor zooming capacity is hardly usable.5. Miui is buggy and bloated, even after paying 68k, you'll have some 3rd party keyboard installed, which we can not uninstalled.6. So many bloatware, for a flagship - Mi should have cleaned it up a bit.7. Worst memory management, memory leak and frequent apps crashing.8. Bugs on video apps. Example YouTube - vidoes just zooms in so much so that video is not visible at all. ( Not video zoom feature on YouTube). Even after restarting app, persists.9. Was unable to install Hotstar app from playstore. Had to finally install it from outside in the web which is not safe. ( No internet issues on wifi and 4g mobile data).10. Unavailability of accessories like. Tampered glass is so irritating. I got scratches in very 1st week on screen.11. Heats up very very badly. I'm not able to hold it for 2 mins. Hands are also heated up. Even simple task of messaging heats up heavily. It's definately a deal breaker.12. Battery drains very fast. Although topping up battery is very quick, a good respectable SOT is necessary. But drains very fast. Not a full day phone at all.If I get anymore experience, will update this. Thanks.",

Upto 5x giver better pics, 10x gives good pics, but 20x no use, gives fade pics.Other phones with 10 mp having better zoom.Main camera is INX sensor, quite good, but others are waste. Pics from main camera only are good, natural colour, quality is very good. Also having Macro mode.Batter is very small, always keep charger, charged with in 30 min. But easly drains also very fastAnd of course uts Xiaomi, Hearing issue always be there.Overall, telescope Camera and battery disappointed",

    "Review": "It's an excellent all-rounder phoneDesign: Excellent design, very premium, excellent in-hand feelDisplay: Top notch display, simply the best, the best I've seen.Charging: Amazing battery charging speed, unbelievable speed just give it 15 minutes to charge full.haptic & vibration: Vibration motor is very strong, you don't miss a call.Sound output: Very good speaker quality, it has quad speaker tuned by Harman, not too loud but sound output is best in mobiles phone.Camera: Camera is excellent day and night, fast n accurate focus, amazing details, color accurate. Natural skin tone, no noise & very pleasing camera experience. 50MP zoom camera is equally good. Ultra wide camera also click stunning pics and can take outstanding macro pics.Selfie:, No autofocus but if got the right distance images are crisp n clearBattery: Its good. getting better each passing day. Give it a time to settle, battery life increases day by day. I'm noticing improvement every day.Heating issue: first day while setting up the device due to heavy download and data transfer, it started heating and it got good enough hot. After that I've not noticed heat while browsing, navigating apps or while using camera to take pics or videos. Give it a time, it'll get better with time.Camera condensation: i tried to replicate it very hard. I tried 5 days i captured videos HD, fhd, 4k for over 10 minutes, i thought it's not in my phone. Again I've not noticed condensation while taking pics even after taking 100s of pics continuously.Capturing 8k video did a trick, after 5.5 minutes of video in 8k recording i noticed a fog which can be seen in the video also. But this fog goes away in 2-3 seconds. Not a serious issue. For normal usage we don't get it, try hard to notice the issue which will be there for 1-3 seconds. I've tried again but could not reproduce one more time, give it a try.Ads: no ads in the UI, absolutely premium flagship experience.I got 12gb/256gb varient for 51k after 8k Bank discount, it's a steal deal for the features it is offering like outstanding qhd display, unbelievable charge speed, excellent quad speaker, great front and selfie camera day n night, top notch performance. And 50w wireless charging which charges phone in 32 minutes is a great nicety I've not tried though. This is a great package for the price of it offered.Give it a time of small hiccups like heating or battery, it'll get better. Go for it if you get it in the offer below 60K",

    "Review": "So after using this for like 4-5 days after purchase :1) There is no automatic charging disconnect ion after 100% battery , it will keep you showing charging even when battery is at 100%.2) Device is bit slippery and back cover is must.3) There is a bug in camera where the reflection of Street light / Head lights are seen upside down on the display. ( Annoying bug )4) Camera quality is good, but can be improved more.5) No notification led. It has breathing pulse effect on display, but that might consume power.6) When using 2K+ resolution with 120Hz , a normal 15W charger is unable to charge battery, instead the battery keeps depleting over time. ( This needs to be fixed)7) When we press volume button to increase / decrease the intensity, the display suddenly goes very bright while the overlay is active and then reduces on its own when the volume overlay is gone.8) Don't put the 120W charger over night and sleep away ! I did smeel something burning and was worried. But seems everything was fine. Take caution about this.9) A normal 15W charger can charge the device in about 2 and half hours with FHD+ and 60Hz settings.10) Phone is a bit , might be tricky to hold the device, but it will vary depending on users.11) Gcam is supported by this device.12) Phone gets warm when intensive task are being used and games are played for long. Chances of getting it hot are higher when the device is at 2K+ and 90Hz/120Hz.13) Battery backup is overall good i will say, it needs be improved.14) Dolby Vision, Dolby Atoms, HDR10+ works fine.(HDR content supported on youtube)15) Playing music for long time on speakers will drain battery.",

The display is damn good with an excellent auto brightness calibration. Just leave it on auto3. Fast face unlock and fingerprint scanner.Works like a charm.4. Lots of customisation options.5.Weight balance is pretty good. Dosen't feel too heavy. Good inhand feel.6. Charging speed is awesome. 20 - 100 % in some 15 mins times (with boost on).7.Box packed with all the necessary accessories including a 3.5mm to Type C dongle which works pretty well.8. The price is a big factor when compared with competition.Cons:1. The battery life is a bit disappointing. Expected more from a 4600mAH unit. With the resolution turned down to FHD+ and refresh rate and brightness set to auto and regular usage (no gaming or extensive use of camera) only about 5 hrs of Screen On Time at max.2. Speaker volume is a bit too low for a dual stereo setup tuned by Harman. Its quite a bit less than my OP8T.3.Calls on loud speaker also are a bit low sounding.",

    "Review": "Review after about 2 week's usage.Looks super premium though feels a tad heavy owing to it's metallic setup near the camera.Had minor heating issues in the initial days but has been ironed out with few minor tweaks.Battery should have been 5000 mAH at this price range. After having disabled auto-start for each of the apps and changing the refresh rate to 60 Hz, able to get a battery backup of 15+hrs with average usage. 120 Watt charging does work but heats up the device which is normal though would suggest to use normal charging if the battery life is to be prolonged unless in urgent need of power.Rear camera is pretty good though the optical zoom is limited to 2x. Ultra wide capture is good enough with minimal distortion.Front camera is good when used in normal lighting, however, it brightens the image too much to ones liking when taken against a bright backdrop. Hoping for it to get resolved in the next update.Please note that I had a weird experience wherein the rear camera lens was covered with moisture trapped between the lens and protective glass cover whilst switched on for the very first time. I had to switch off the rear camera for the trapped moisture to subside after having to wait for few minutes.Has dual speakers labelled Harmon Kardon on them but has a strange echo being generated while playing few genres. I am still trying to figure it out by tweaking the equalisers.OS has minor glitches like the default apps set doesn't work as they should and the files open in MI based apps only.Overall a good buy though could have been a flagship killer had these minor glitches been ironed out.",

I have turned off unnecessary sensors, display refresh rate is reduced to 60, brightness kept to auto, dark mode. Battery is sufficient for a decent usage.

Biggest  problem : Video: 4K 60fps, recording causes camera fogging, also observed with 4K 30fls recording too. That's horrible manufacturing defect and it didnot go away even after taking 10 rounds of videos and giving rest, as suggested by someone and still continues.Also received phone with just 1 percent charge.. that means somebody used it already? repackaging and sending to others???Asked for replacement and waiting.Technician visit assigned : and it was so dumb no body turned out for the slot wasting my office time for another half day. Rescheduled and waiting.Someone has to sue Amazon and Xiaomi together for faulty sets and not replacing them easily.",

One can compare the flow of text on phones like oppo find x2 and iqoo 9 Pro and you will notice that on these phones the text and pictures bend to the sides when you scroll horizontally. But in this phone you can clearly see that it's a flat scroll!!!Connectivity over mobile network is not good in closed rooms. While the Asus rog 5 and the Oppo find x2 show upto 4 bands on the network indicator this phone goes down to 2! -95 to -100 for the Asus and the Oppo while it's -115 to -119 for the Xiaomi! That's poor!Has a good display - but not anywhere near the Oppo find x2 which is way brighter! Difficult to believe that this phone has a peak brightness of 1500 nits!Even though this is on Android 12 the miui software is not as good as color os. Recent apps can't be swiped up like in other phones, they need to be swiped to the side!Accessibility features for apps like Nova launcher etc keep getting disabled even if battery optimisation is turned off! Features like double tap to lock screen don't work, which is very bad!!!There is no option to pick colours from the wallpaper or to change the colour accent of the icons etc, which is disappointing!Finally one important point - the first phone which i received was faulty. It failed to detect the sim and used to heat up and force the user to wipe the data, and if not used to keep rebooting! Amazon replaced the phone, and the second piece is working normally. If anyone faces the same issue please inform Amazon immediately.",

    "Comment": "Showstopper Indeed! Best flagship of 2022",
    "Review": "When I first heard of the xiaomi 12 pro, I wasn't too sure whether the phone would live upto the marketing term of \"The Showstopper\"As I was pleasantly surprised, the phone indeed does live upto its reputation. Now, keep in mind that I also have a 13 pro max which is a work phone and I quite enjoyed the cameras on it especially.After getting the Xiaomi 12 Pro, I have to be honest that I haven't used my iPhone much apart from work emails and thats primarily because the camera experience has been fantastic so far. Yes, of course 50 MP resolution on all three cameras is great to have but I think we need to focus on the quality of output and this is incredibly good and consistent across all cameras not just in day light but even low light.Ultra Night Mode is a gamechanger and so is the focusing with profocus technology. No more blurry photos and you get night mode on all cameras.The display experience has also been great indoors and outdoors and I did try watching a few videos and bit of films on Netflix and the experience is amazing especially thanks to the audio. The amoled screen with dolby vision and hdr10+ is amazing but I feel the audio is one part others overlook.13 pro max is loud but the bottom speaker is louder while the top one is quite feeble. This gives equal loud output but thanks to the quad speaker with 2 woofer and 2 tweeter, Im getting better bass in music and movies also feel more immersive.Haptics are great too for gaming and typing. Performance has been great so far and I was worried about 8Gen1 as my friend has an S22 Ultra that over heats especially when gaming or using the cameras, luckily on this, no heating or issue with cameras.Charging is a lifechanger too. Had already tried 11T Pro which I got for my wife but now with this, its smarter too. Surge P1 they say is indias first intelligent charging chip, I love how fast it charges. Using boost mode I get 18-19 mins 100% from almost a flat battery but in most cases I charge my phone from 15 or 20% and this takes approx 15 mins only and unlike other flagships, they are giving the 120W charger in box. I am using the same for my Dell XPS also.Overall, I was not sure if this would be a great purchase but very happy to say that it has been amazing so far and I would definitely recommend this to others as well.",

But when i watched some YouTube videos and read some reviews on Amazon about how people are facing Fogg issues in its camera, i immediately turned on my camera and started shooting videos, and guess what?? It only took 2 minutes and a few seconds and the camera was all fogged up. This is not at all acceptable from a company charging 55000rs for a phone. I have submitted a request for exchange and i'll edit my review as soon as i get my solution on this Fogg machine.",
