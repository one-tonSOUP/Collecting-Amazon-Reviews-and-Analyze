I am currently working on data analysis on this project, so you may not find any code relevant to data analysis or proper data visualization right now.
The only code you'll find helpful to scrape amazon review data from a product url is "collectingreviewsfromamazon.py".
Please check this repo later in future to find any review analysis code.
