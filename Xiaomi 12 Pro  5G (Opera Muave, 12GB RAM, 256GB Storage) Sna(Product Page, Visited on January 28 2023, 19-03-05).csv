Mayur patil,"Size: 8GB RAM, 256GB StorageColour: Noir Black",3.0,⭐⭐⭐,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 8 October 2022,FOGGY CAMERA WITH AN OVEN INSIDE,"I didn't knew the issue that this phone has Fogg issues in its camera and I bought it blindly. But when i watched some YouTube videos and read some reviews on Amazon about how people are facing Fogg issues in its camera, i immediately turned on my camera and started shooting videos, and guess what?? It only took 2 minutes and a few seconds and the camera was all fogged up. This is not at all acceptable from a company charging 55000rs for a phone. I have submitted a request for exchange and i'll edit my review as soon as i get my solution on this Fogg machine.","https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/transparent-pixel._V192234675_.gif, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IrO2lfV-L._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VmkksscxL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hMpXiVQHL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51IrO2lfV-L._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51VmkksscxL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hMpXiVQHL._SY88.jpg",9 people found this helpful
