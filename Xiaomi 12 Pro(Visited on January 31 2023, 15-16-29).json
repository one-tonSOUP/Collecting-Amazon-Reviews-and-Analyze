    "Review": "The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\u00a0Jan 6th:-Yet to get any security patch after Sep 2022!.. It has been 4 months since now.. I'm disappointed frankly in terms of updates.. I understand that the phone is due & should be amongst 1st to get Android 13 based MiUI 14 to arrive anytime now.. But that is not an excuse to not provide this long!.. I expected a Dec 2022 update atleast by now..In terms of battery there has been a decline in backup esp when on mobile data.. Thanks to 5G network now.. For whatever reason the auto brightness of the phone is continuously very high than what is required (adding to average battery performance).. There has been a few stutters in the UI I'm noticing which could be again related to lack of updates!.. Also I notice very aggressive RAM management performance where certain apps get killed immediately as soon as I get out of it!.. Possibly it's got to do with MiUI's irritating battery saving attempt..Anyways hoping for some improvements in my next update.. Fingers crossed..Nov 27th:-Got my vodafone primary sim ported to Airtel & have Jio as my secondary sim.. Both are giving me 5g internet with Jio giving consistently more 5g connectivity than Airtel. The Phone is blazing fast now in terms of browsing & YouTube etc.. Attaching some screen for 5g performance of the phone!..Oct 19th:-Got an update to enable 5g services for the phone. Under settings though I don't see any changes.Had been to Kashmir vacation where the phone was used fully.. The battery loss was quiet significant outdoors on mobile data with 2 sim cards.. The main reason for it is it's display that's almost at full brightness in auto mode.. Also due to poor signals in Kashmir, the phone is continously working to look for a stable mobile network.. The photos came out fantastic for it's segment & I was comparing it against iPhone 13 Mini/ iPhone 12 Pro/ iPhone 12/ S20 FE 5G of my cousins.. A lot of times my cousins preferred me to take the main cam shots from Xiaomi 12 Pro over others!.. The selfie performance was average at best though.. The telephoto/ zoom performance was toe to toe with iPhone 12 Pro in both photos & videos!!.. Coming to the most controversial video shooting performance, most of the videos ranging from 30 secs to nearly 10 mins in the most unique HDR10+ quality came out fabulous!!.. The video quality was not comparable to iPhone 12 Pro/ 13 as soon as the natural lights came down though.. The iPhones showed their superiority clearly in low light/ sunset videos..Will keep updating my experience further as days go..Oct 9th:-Have got September security patch. The routine is one security patch every 2-3 months typical of Xiaomi.. The update had nothing else other than security patch in it..The phone is otherwise performing same n is top notch & Im extremely happy with the device..Sep 17th:-Performance of the phone has improved now!.. Xiaomi has done some magic.. Even the phones highest cpu temperature against any load is only 60 degrees as against 75 degrees before!Attaching new benchmark app results..Aug 29th:-Attaching some screenshots from my phone for all the battery life cribbers & potential customers & interested fellows..I got a Screen On Time (SOT) of over 7:30 hours today!!!.. See for yourself before judging the battery life of Xiaomi 12 Pro.. I have also attached a set of screenshots from my phone settings that affect battery life..Always give time to your phone & the advanced AI in it to start reading what kind of user it is working with!.. My phone is 20+ days old now & it has learnt how I use my phone & how to optimise it.. So dont jump to conclusions by looking at your phone in hours!!..My phone today was used indoors mainly with mostly on Wifi but has 2 SIMs in it.. Bluetooth on for occasional smartphone connectivity & other settings in the screenshot.. Also reiterating that the phone has very good standby battery time too even with Always On Display..Aug 25th:-Attaching 4K@60fps video of 2 mins length.. I tried attaching 5 mins video I shot but Amazon says the file is too big to be attached!.. So I can't upload the 5 mins video.. What I can confirm though is no camera fogging visible anymore in the rear sensor.. Nor is the video shootage (both videos) had any fogging visible at all!!.. Remember we are talking about a phone that had it originally..After 5+2 mins of 4K@60fps, the phone was warm.. The battery temperature showed 45 degrees max.. Just FYI..Aug 24th:-I see a lot of customers are unhappy with the phone after purchasing as there is fog in the rear camera. They rate the phone 1 star & want to return it.. It's their wish as it's their product/ money..But I had a suggestion to kind off resolve this issue as I have done for my phone.. I made 2 videos today to test the situation.. 5 mins 4K@60fps videos each from the main rear sensor.. I had no fogging issues to note!!.. Just to remind the readers, my phone also had camera fogging issue while shooting videos from the main cam in the past (have made a note of it in my review below for reference)..So what did I do to resolve the issue.. Just shoot 5 mins length 4K@60fps videos from the main camera.. Shoot 10 videos back to back of 5 mins length in the same resolution.. The phone will heat up badly.. Let it heat up.. Once done shooting 10 videos.. Come out of the camera app & leave the phone to cool down.. Don't bother shooting a video to test anymore.. Give it 1 days time & meanwhile use your phone normally for any other function.. Test the video the next day & check whether the issue persists.. If it still does, you can return the product.. Otherwise all well & good.. I lost both 5 mins videos I shot this evening.. I will update a 5 mins video in a day or 2 for you to see the video quality yourself n whether there's any foggy tone in the video..Aug 20th:-Bought Xiaomi 12 Pro for 50K on Aug 7th in sale after card & coupon discounts.. Below is my experience so far in these 12 days;-Like to start with the display which is the best part about the phone.. This is one of the best ever screens on any smartphone ever!!.. A curved display that is 6.73\" E5 Amoled that is 120hz, LTPO 2, 10 Bit, QHD+, Dolby Vision, with 1050 nits max brightness (gsmarena tested) screen.. That has wonderful viewing angles, absolutely stunning hardware with no screen leak or dirty screen effects like it's competitors' inconsistent/ poor QCd units!.. Absolute \u2764.. A few cons that I noticed though is the phone has more accidental touch issue due to curved screen than say my previous phones iQOO 9Pro & Samsung Note20Ultra.. Also the phone doesn't come with a pre applied screen protector.. Had to get a good quality screen protector for 1000 rupees..Nextly the speakers & audio quality.. It's got Harmon Kardon tuned quad speakers (2 woofers + 2 tweeters), with 2 dedicated outlets, that is excellent.. Yes, it's not the loudest esp when compared to iphones & Samsung flagships & Oneplus flagships.. But the quad speakers show their speciality with a full range of sound & with it's richness during any kind of audio output.. Compared the audio with my wife's iPhone 12 (as good as any iphone 13 series) & that's where I make these observations.. Also I've owned Samsung flagships in the past to add on to the experience..Design & Build wise.. the phone is of the highest order possible with excellent design & color options along with a solid/ very stylish metal frame that syncs with Gorilla Glass Victus display on the front & Gorilla Glass 5 glass on the hind.. The bezels in the top & bottom isn't the snallest of all though n the curve at the edges could be more boxy for my liking than the current design that's more roundish.. All in all the phone syncs overall with the Purple hue beautifully to make it a piece of art!.. The only sore miss is an IP68 rating sadly..MiUi 13 on the phone is running July 2022 security update & the UI is polished & has excellent animations n look n feel!.. I have used phones with One UI, Color OS, Realme UI, Funtouch OS, iOS, Stock Androids (never used Oxygen OS though).. My most favorite UI for style n look n animations & feel has to be MiUI amongst all!.. The sheer array of Wallpapers (incl free Live Wallpapers), Themes, Fonts that's available for free is unbelievably good n incomparable!!.. The way the haptics have been integrated into the UI is best of all to add on.. The haptic motor is amongst the best too!.. All is not roses for MiUI though with slightly lower stability in terms of smoothness & consistency when compared to Color OS & One UI which are butter smooth.. The battery & general optimization is very well done though.. There were about 5-6 unwanted apps out of the box but most were straight uninstall while a few others I could remove using the adb function.. Overall very happy with the software experience so far.. Also adding on is a promise of 3 Major Android  updates until Android 15 & security patches for 4 years!.. What is to be noted is Xiaomi doesn't provide prompt monthly updates.. It is only periodic like say once in 2 to 4 months which is not great..Call quality over ear piece & mic & speaker is excellent.. The signal reception for sim card of various vendors - Vodafone/ Airtel/ Jio is all fine with very rare issues (I blame it to poor service than phone).. Wifi performance is fabulous with the best mobile modem attached to Snapdragon 8Gen1.. Bluetooth connectivity, NFC n all other modes of connectivity are top notch.. So very happy with these most primary functions on any phone..Cameras wise the highlight is the primary rear custom made 50MP sensor Sony IMX707 which is fantastic in literally every condition for photography!.. It has 1 big issue that has to be addressed though.. The rear primary camera fogging while shooting video for anything more than 1.5 mins.. But this rear camera fogging isn't consistent & sometimes it doesnt do it n fine too inbetween!.. But it's inconsistent for it's unpredictable performance.. The Ultrawide & Telephoto/ Portrait cameras consist of 2 50MP Samsung JN1 sensors respectively.. This is an excellent setup & they work very well for most functions.. The Telephoto/ Portrait cam has only 2X Optical zoom but that's a good enough feature with sharp & pleasing zoom pics.. The Telephoto cam lacks OIS which is a miss according to me & wouldve helped in low light zoom.. Similarly the Ultrawide cam lacks Autofocus & that doesn't make it a Macro cam which is sad.. All 3 rear cams can shoot good quality 4K@60fps videos with excellent stability!.. The night time photo/ video shooting is also top notch thanks to excellent implementation of bright flash with good flash timing & length to assist.. Overall very capable rear cameras.. Selfie cam wise it's a 32MP Omnivision sensor which isn't great hardware wise.. I would've wished a top Sony sensor instead.. The dynamic range of the selfie is very limited.. The phone takes a full 32MP snap & isn't pixel binned yet the sharpness isn't great n the photos come out slightly soft.. Yet Xiaomi's excellent post processing capabilities make the selfie cam Above Average overall for stills.. Night mode in selfie helps brighten the screen for additional light while autofocus assistance by the AI system for selfie helps a great deal overall.. Selfie video shooting is capped at 1080p@60fps resolution at max but has very good stability due to EIS.. Overall a very good camera experience considering I'm not too much of a video shooter..Battery backup has been good.. Yes I'm saying good unlike many in this forum.. The users should understand that the phone has an SOC thats amongst the fastest & more powerful on the planet n a sportscar can never give you a commuter car's fuel efficiency!.. Well apart from this logic have attached a couple of screenshots where I have easily recorded over 6hrs of Screen On Time!.. This is with always only at 120hz + QHD+ + Other visual enhancement settings + Always on display all the time + Live Wallpaper + high haptics but with only dark mode & Auto brightness enabled (Auto brightness is generally on high brightness most of the times).. The phone has excellent idle time battery optimization thanks to MiUI.. The 120 watts charger tops up the phone in quick time but has a USB Type A to Type C connectors.. It isn't say as fast charging as iQOO 9 Pro's more mordern Type C to Type C port that charges more faster.. Finally the heating aspect of the phone.. Please note that amongst the Snapdragon 8Gen1 phones like - Samsung S22 series, OnePlus 10Pro, iQOO 9Pro, Realme GT2 etc.. Only Xiaomi 12 Pro has unrestricted 8Gen1 speed (ie not downclocking the chipset in the fear of overheating).. The phone consistently scores above 9 lacs in Antutu with CPU score of over 2 lacs no matter any condition unlike all of it's competitors!.. The others have downclocked their chipsets to control overheating.. What this means is Yes the chipset is notorious for overheating when stressed.. I have seen a max of 75 degrees celcius of CPU & 50 degrees of battery Temperature when pushed to it's extreme in Antutu test.. Also when I shot multiple 4K videos of 5 mins length for more than 30 mins at a stretch, got a message saying the phone has overheated & give it a break.. So yes the phone has overheating issue but again only when pushed to heavy duty.. Otherwise for regular operation it is fine.. Runs at a CPU temperature ranging from 40 to 50 degrees & battery from 32 to 42 degrees which is normal..The fingerprint sensor is a regular optical unit.. It is nowhere near as fascinating/ secure/ fast as iQOO 9 Pro's 3D Ultrasonic unit that's just the best ever!..On the whole at 50K there cannot be a better smartphone than this ever!.. Really happy with the phone also considering it's cons..I whole heartedly recommend this phone to all until you are a frequent video shooter & a gamer (overheating issue)..",

    "Comment": "Almost a flagship, but with lot of sacrifices and issues",
    "Review": "The ratings i gave are considering other flagship phones in nearby price range from competitorsj(OnePlus/Samsung/Oppo/Vivo/Realme/Motorola/Apple/Pixel/Asus)!Battery drain is very significant even when idle, didn't expect it in a flagship. (Looses 8-15% at night, when always on display is off, vibration is off, mobile data/WiFi is off)[Update September 2022: With latest software updates, battery drain when idle seems to have resolved to some extent. Also, there is no performance sacrifices for this. So, now I wouldn't consider battery drain a huge negative point, as the charging is really fast]Also, even for for just casual usages there is slight heating issue, when outside temperature is 30-33\u00b0C (an average temperature in India; For those in cold places, there are issues too... keep reading!)On gaming, it throttles a lot along with overheating at times, maybe given performance equivalent to Snapdragon 855 or 845, when heated up! Maybe going with Mi 11 Ultra would be a better choice, or go for 8Gen1 devices from other companies or wait for 8Gen1+! I really regret the decision to buy this phone, been using it for 1 week now!!!I have been using Xiaomi products for many years, and decided to believe and buy a flagship from this company. But so far the experience is disappointing, and gives a midrange feel in many areas... Over heating when used outside, for just regular usages, like Gmail, browsing the internet, Amazon etc... Also, though the charging is fast, the battery drain is fast too...And the camera needs a lot of optimization. Daylight photos, many times it's over exposed and over saturated and cases can be reddish. And HDR doesn't always work well. Its sometimes a disappointing performance, considering its supposed to be a flagship camera! Even that can be fixed by a software update...And maybe a good Gcam port is all I can hope for, if someone makes it, as i don't have much hope from Xiaomi... But surely there are hardware issues too...Overheating is surely somewhat an hardware issue, given the negative feedback of 8Gen1...But the implementation in Mi 12 pro, seems so poor, and it makes things worse. It's advertising industry leading cooling systems, but performance isn't reflecting it!Also, i recently went to a hill station(temperature was 13-20\u00b0C) and on trying the camera there, the phone heats up even there on using camera for few minutes, and fog got formed in the internal camera lens of the main camera unit, which is quite disappointing!  (Note: it's not outside the camera, that it can be wiped, but inside the camera.And saw in online forums and YouTube that it's a general issue with this model, especially the Chinese and Indian ones! Search and you can find the issue)Hope the device doesn't get under-clocked, because I and most people who opt for a flagship care about high end performance.So Xiaomi, if you are reading this, we all hope, an alternative fix for overheating can be implemented with software that doesn't involve sacrificing the performance of 8Gen1! I will wait and see how Xiaomi takes feedback and fixes these issues(I have filled feedback using the feature provided within the phone)...I am not even sure if customer feedback is even considered and I am doubting the trust and decision of buying a premium phone from Xiaomi...On a positive note, the screen is excellent, main camera module is great in low light (though there are hiccups at times), also zoom camera isn't great, given its a 2x telephoto!The IR blaster, is a nice to have. Also it checks most of the features that is expected in a flagship. But it doesn't have an official IP rating, though they say its built to be IP 53 compliant. But flagships should be having IP 68.Performance is smooth, which is expected, but there are software glitches at times, and the issue of overheating and battery drain! As the battery keeps draining fast, and if we keep charging with 120W, battery life is a question... Don't think it will last much long!The charger is insane, but heavy and not very travel friendly....  And claimed charging speed of 18 mins isn't achievable unless phone doesn't heat up, which isn't possible unless you give it active cooling while charging!Realistically you get from 0-100% in 25-30 mins!",

    "Review": "1. Look & Feel: 10/10. Good look device with amazing built quality. No doubt a flagship experience.2. Display: 10/10. Amazing display with 144 hz refresh rate and really bright. Easily beats iphone 14 and hold its own ground against even S22 ultra! This is as good as it gets. Although if I have to nit-pick, the auto brightness does screw up sometimes and you will have to manually adjust the brightness for best viewing experience. Also make sure you go into setting and select 2k & 144 hz resolution. The system default out of the box is FHD+ only. I am pretty sure it\u2019s made to save battery. onscreen fingerprint reader is reliable & works well.3. Camera: 8/10. Camera is great for most part. I have observed it works best in 4:3 aspect ratio. I like my photos to fill the screen. In 16:9 or higher aspect ratio, many a times there is fish eye effect as well some blur on the edges. If you want to compare it to the true flagships, it definitely cannot compete. But it is still one of the best cameras out there.4. Battery Life: 6/10. Battery life is average at best. 5 hours screen on time with about 13 hours runtime is the best you can expect.5. SOC: 5/10. This phone has heating issues if you are a gamer or heavy user. Normal usage, heating is not an issue. Snapdragon 8 gen 1 definitely is a big hit & miss. Do not buy this phone if you are looking for heavy usage and gaming.6. Software: 6/10. For most part the software is great. But with long term usage you will start noticing:a. Bloatware! Too many unnecessary apps, some you cannot even uninstall. The \u2018Get app\u2019 app store which is a system app and cannot be uninstalled keeps pushing you to install more bloatware!!b. Most widgets cannot be resized. Resizing widget is almost common sense now a days in android phones, cannot believe they have botched this up in this phone!c. Some high-end features like converting youtube videos into 2k in real time doesn\u2019t work and many such features are just gimmicks at best.7. Keyboard: 5/10. There is some good haptic feedback while typing, but that is where the goodness ends. The autocorrect is downright horrible and I found typing is not that fast!8. Network: 5/10. If you are city dweller, you wouldn\u2019t find this aspect as lacking. But if you are in hard-to-reach network places, I found this device quite lacking. In many places in my home where I used to get full network in my old phone, I get only 2 bars in this. And at the slightest hint of low network, it completely goes out of network.",

    "Review": "Overall it's a good quality phone. The outer layer of the box came in wet wich some oil/moisture all over the box. But i guess it didn't affect the phone.  I have been using it for over a week. The battery could have lasted a little longer but the fast charging makes up for it. Some apps especially the unpopular ones tend to crash here and there with MIUI which users must note. My biggest issue is when i record videos at 1080p at 30 or 60 fps, and i send it over WhatsApp...the video gets compressed so much that it's laggy and unwatchable. Overall ..I'm happy with the product",

Cameras are just awesome not as other phones like a cameras count. Triple cameras which is really worth. Primary, Ultra wide and mainly Telephoto triple 50MP as well as 32MP selfie. Charging speed really awesome but battery is average. Because for a day am charging twice. Sound quality this time am totally impressed.

    "Comment": "Its a beautiful BEAST which needs some hardware fixing by XAIOMI",
    "Review": "Guys you would not need to read any other review after this one. I will sum it up very clearly.This phone is a BEAST! I have only rated it 3 stars because of xaiomi not taking care of their best phone in the market, even i had to return it as well due to reasons I will mention below. I ordered this phone via an exchange of an old phone with broken screen in the sale which made this phone cost me around 35k which was a decent price since I always buy phones from 20k to 35k. The moment I received the mobile i was gone crazy. The way it looked was awesome, the way it felt in the hand was great, very premium! Massive 120 watt charging in just 20 mins was so lovely. I have used Lenovo,Vivo,poco, samsung,one plus but this one is the most wonderful looking phone I have ever held. Screen so responsive that even iPhone seems it's child. Camera so fantastic that i fell in love with the first video i recorded with it. potrait shot is whole new level. Great stabilization in the camera and speakers in the phone is just a cherry on top of the cake. Apart from this AI features to add a crisp on your video experience. Back camera is the just amazing but the front is just ok in comparison with the back one but does good enough. Now why did i only give it 3 stars and returned it. Well reason was that it had a minor issue of heating too much and battery draining quickly which was a little wears because I wasn't using the device heavily. I am very use to using mobiles and I know how fastly does a phone battery drain based on the usage but the the unit I got was draining unnecessarily but apart from battery everything else was a charm mind it guys so I ordered a replacement later, the next unit i received was a nightmare because this time I was having issues with the camera but not with the battery. The battery this time was draining according to my usage. Since it has tones of features supporting the next level amoled display so battery consumption was similar to that and I was pretty much ok with this device because it has a massive 120 wt charging which in 20 mins charged the phone from 20 to 100. So who cares if you get to charge your phone twice a day.But this unit has serious issues with the back camera. Fogs accumulated everytime I used the phone to make videos. This was irritating so I had to return it again. Remember friends the first unit i received had a battery issue and the second i received had a camera issue which means xaiomi is not taking care of the phone manufacturing up to the mark. The phone is excellent only if anyone gets the right unit.Now who should buy it?The one who has a good amount of savings with himself who can just buy a phone with a flaw or two, doesn't care if the unit had a battery issue or like that. I would have kept the phone avoiding the battery issue in the first unit since it can be charged in 15 minutes if i had good savings which I don't \ud83d\ude02 so I had to return it.If someone wants to know more about this phone he can mail me his queries at shashankkshekharr1990@gmail.com. i will happily clear any doubts.",

Could not buy another option because of this issue and jo one in Amazon also knows the same. Go for it if you get a good exchange value. As this is a top line phone so what to write. Just need to use it for some time for proper battery backup information.",

    "Comment": "Brilliant phone crippled down by heating",
    "Review": "Been using this phone for 7 days now. My review during this breif period are as below:1. Display: The best out there. Nothing can get better than QHD+, 2K, 120Hz LTPO, Dolby vision, HDR10+ display. Its vibrant however the QHD+ drains more battery. FHD+ resolution isn't bad either. So I have set for FHD+ and during OTT consumption I change to QHD+.2. Speakers: Tuned by Harman Kardon, it's not the loudest but the quality of the output is great. You can feel the difference when paired with any earphones.3. Processor: The hottest processor by Qualcomm \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01. Made by Samsung, this processor has turned the fortunes of Qualcomm. Since the performance is not tuned down, so the processor tends to get warm with normal usage and hot with heavy usage. Xiaomi need to push OTA to limit the processor otherwise we can cook omlette on this during summers.4. Cameras: Triple 50MP set up delivers exceptionally well photos. Many people are getting fog issue in the camera. I haven't got this. I have tried recording 4k @30 and 60fps and 8k @24fps both in indoors as well as outdoors. No such issue found. Selfie is least used in my phone so can't really comment on that.5. Software: I have been using MiUI since 2018 and I really adapt to the UI of any phone. As Xiaomi has promised 3 yrs of Android update and 4 yrs of security updates so the phone will go till Android 15. That's a good sign.6. Charger: The 120W charger is heavy. But I have not used boost charger. I use normal charging which is quite fast. Also I use 22.5W mi charger for better battery life.7. Battery life: First it was giving around 5hrs of SOT. Then it increased to 7hrs. Actually the phone is adapting itself. So the SOT will increase after few usage. Also I'm using this as my secondary phone as of now.8. Finger print is slow. And I think the area for fingerprint is also bit smaller.Bought this after exchanging my favourite Redmi K20 pro @37000. At that price I felt I should give it a try. Earlier thought of Samsung S22+ but my budget was upto 50k. So I could not stretch myself upto that. Will update more when I use the phone extensively.",

    "Comment": "Really great phone at 43K",
    "Review": "Ok I am giving this review about the phone after my normal day to day use of 20+ days.1st of all let's talk about the FOG issue. My unit had a FOG issue when it arrived and some people said that updating it to latest MIUI 13.0.9 is fixing the FOG issue but it didn't happen on my phone. After 8 days I switched to EU ROM and the fog issue is not there anymore. Created 15 mins. 4K 60 FPS video without any issue. But the FOG issue is a hardware problem so changing a rom simply eliminating the problem is completely out of my mind and some people also said that their fog issue disappeared after updating to official 13.0.9 so I guess the Fog issue will disappear automatically once you use your phone for 10+ days. That's when Mine went away and I used the camera only 2 times for creating 4k 60 fps videos of 3-4 mins. for ofcourse fog issue testing purposes.Now the Battery life: Screenshot is given with this review about how is this phone's battery life on daily basis with normal usage and No gaming sessions on EU ROM which is normal for this kind of flagship phones.Heating Issue: I never encountered any heating issues with my phone on official 13.0.9. Same goes with EU rom. ialways sit below or on 30\u00b0 CUntil a better official update comes, this phone is strictly for those who knows how to flash a rom and can spare some time on customising their phone. If you are a guy who only sticks with official updates and roms then stay away for now.",

    "Comment": "over-heating issue after 2 months usage",
    "Review": "[---- changed my review to 1 star because after using this device for 2 months , its heating too much even in normal usage and very low display settings.i set it to fhd only and refresh rate 60hz only. still temperature reaches 40 degree in normal usage . my previous device had sd865, and compare to that this feels a downgrade solely because of the overheating issue. all other things are great no doubt but what good they do if i am not able to hold the mobile on my palm for more than 5 minutes. tried many solutions like resetting , debloating . none helpful so far. xiaomi should release a software fix for this issue. but they are busy launching new devices to sell but no long term support even in flagship devices . disappointing  ----]i mainly bought the device because of the value for money and most importantly the display . the display is top notch. here are some things that i noticed.#1.  the wqhd 2k display is totally worth it , colors are sharp , clarity is excellent , dolby visions further optmizes the video and images. dolby vision gives you feeling of watching movies on big tv screen . you have to enable it for every app , filter style hdr . but cant find any good tempered glass in the market for this device. that fits ut correctly#2.  camera produces very good colors  . i have used other flagships and its much better than anything i have seen so far first hand. rest you can see in attached images. although camera isn't my priority but i know when i see a good camera.#3.  heating is what i was worried about but it even heats less than my older device with sd865 .  here it is hot climate these days . but for normal usage its battery remained within 38-42 degree celcius . cpu too ranges between 38 to 45 depending on your usage . ambient temperature is important factor here . i did not do gaming as of now , but will update later in this review after playing BGMI . also the device cools faster than any other device that i have used . [ edit : i played BGMI and very smooth experience . you do neeed to tweak some graphic settings though. 90hz rfresh rate is sufficient for this game , did not feel it heating more than the ordinary, do not play games while charging this device i suggest ]#4. speed and productivity is super smooth . sd 8 gen 1 is worth it . all apps open so smoothly . i found big difference in compare to my previous device mi 10t pro  which has sd865 .  if i had to guess it is almost 100% jump in terms of speed and performance.#6. dolby atmos is good , increases sound quality#7. battery backup is i guess normal . i don't feel much difference Between sd865 and sd 8 gen 1 battery consumption. if you want your battery SOT longer . do not use charging boost feature. battery -backup will increase then.#8. miui 13 is good optmized in this device in  compare to miui 12.5 that i used to have in my older device  .#9. indisplay fingerprint scanner is not that fast i think it needs further software optimisations. it gives warning of \"only use compatible screen protector\" , but do not provide any information where i can  find that  . i am yet to receive tempered glass that i ordered , i will update once i apply that and see if fingerprint sensor still works after applying or not  .#10. there is no pre- applied screen protector#11. silicon back case cover that comes with it... is really really good.  perfectly designed.#12. design is good . doesnt feel bulky . weight distribution is really nicely done.#13.  opera Mauve color seems good that i bought, but i did expect better#14. the back part i dont know if it is gorilla glass or something else . but it feels different. may be its scratch resistant or not i have no idea . but its definitely dust resistant.overall excellent flagship . i got 12 gb 256gb version for only 57k after discount. worth it.i bought this device after comparing it with other sd 8 gen 1 , found this one good on paper so chose it . now i can say it is as good as in reality too .i will update the review if i face any issues ,Note- for temperature monitor use 'cpu monitor' app it shows overall cpu temperature and not just of one core.",

    "Comment": "Feedback on MIUI",
    "Review": "I used to own Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro purchased in USA before this one. The camera quality was okay but not anywhere comparable with the flagship phone's quality. But I really liked MIUI (12.5 I suppose) and hence went for another Xiaomi model as an upgrade.It was a surprise when I found that MIUI 13 chose to use Google apps for Phone, Contacts and SMS. There is no equivalent Xiaomi app available on Play Store that supports its new phone models. I dislike all these three Google apps because of its choice of funky Google Sans font and lack of features. Also, I find the text used throughout the phone is less consistent in terms of font-size and line spacing.Another small feedback I want to add is something that I think should be fixable by Xiaomi through a software update. When I use Xiaomi 12 Pro in a room illuminated with warm light such as incandescent bulb, the phone screen suddenly goes dark, as if the auto-brightness setting only has sensitivity to blue lights. Because of this, I need to manually bring up the screen brightness once every day. I am not sure how to channel this feedback directly to Xiaomi and check if this issue affects many users in case there is a user forum watched by Xiaomi.Do not misunderstand my review as purely negative. MIUI 13 brings host of quality-of-life features and the positives outweigh the negatives, but I think that somewhere they have loosen the grip on consistency and aesthetics on the way of adding new features.",

    "Review": "Absolutely Stunning !!!This review is for those who are still doubtful to buy or not.This is going to be a long review so take a moment to read if whish to.Overall: This is an amazing device packed with all top notch features that anyone looks before buying.I have waited for almost 8 months to buy this and was extremely confused with the reviews complaining about Heating issues (majorly), camera etc etc etc.None basically. This is a beast phone.Design \u2013 So aesthetic, feels premium, the heft in hand weight balance is so balanced that makes it a perfect in hand feeling.Display: Gorgeous. As simple as that.Call Quality \u2013 absolutely perfect.Call reception \u2013 sometimes I see network reception is less but calls comes and goes. Sometime I have see calls drops also but that is difficult to say is because of handset.Media / Sound \u2013 Pleasure. Right balance.Camera \u2013 perfect light \u2013 difficult to beat, low light, a bit of struggle. Front camera \u2013 satisfying images.Battery \u2013 Less ofcouse, as it is packed with features which consumes battery. At the same time gives very powerful charger hence can\u2019t be complained.Performance \u2013 If you are media consumer, emails, texts, banking, documents, and everything that does not include gaming \u2013 difficult to beat this device.Gaming \u2013 I never play games on phone.Heating \u2013 Yes, very very acceptable. The processor itself is like this. But only when use Camera for long, use phone over Mobile data only.Verdict \u2013 just go for it. It will not disappoint.",

    "Review": "I bought this product at Rs. 35290/- valued at 58,999/- with all discounts and EMI during festive sale season in September'22.Product was delivered on 5th October, Amazon bag was open condition and no invoice inside but mobile box was intact. Delivery was done late at night even though promised to deliver in Afternoon. Maybe, too many deliveries during festive season.Product is good, fast processor, battery lasts longer time, charging 10% to 100% within 15 minutes, fast charging. However some basic features missing in Mi like adjusting apps in alphabetical order, contacts by scanning a visiting card, etc... These are basic features which are available in a low value vivo, realme, or oppo phone.Mi needs to improve basic functionality related features on their platform so users life becomes easier.I will give 4 out of 5 as I am unsatisfied with basic features only.Technicallly phone is good.Heats up at charging but that's normal for fast charging phones.",

Slow motion---fogggggggingBut fog disappeared after 2-3 minutes.Night photos are not that great.We can record videos in 4k 60 fps in ultra wide and in telephoto mode...fog is not gonna appear...Because we didn't stress the main camera... finally we can some how record the video 4k 60 fps....HDR+ feature didn't work in ultra wide and telephoto mode...................................................Display is one of the most beautiful thing in this phone. Amazing curved screen guys.... excellent mind blowing....Speaker are not that much powerful...Average speakers....Don't expect too much from them...Gaming is decent...Charging is blazing fast...Didn't notice any bugs ...No laggingI didn't do video recording regularly..so decided to keep the phone with me rather than returning it back....Apart from camera (video recording issue)Phone is beast....",

Overall it's 8/10 but fogging issue soo it comes down to a 3/10 as Overall Experience- Front camera is good 7/10- Great Haptic feedback 8/10- Already poor battery life then 5G is around the corner after 5G more bad battery performance \ud83d\ude05 though it has All the 5G bands Required \ud83d\udc4d 5/10 for battery- Average Wi-Fi!!!! I was shocked to see the lack of Speed/Stability with it's Wi-Fi maybe problem in my unit or the Latest Update problem but it's just Sad to witness this in a Flagship device. 6/10-Network Reception is good and calling is better experience. 9/10 for Network reception and great mic \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f- it's heavy \ud83d\ude36 atleast to me and my friends it felt Heavy and uneasy weighing around 200Grams. 4/10 for bad experience \ud83d\ude36- Not IP Certified for such Costliest Mi device is another Disappointment for many Consumers but felt doable for my case- it gets Warm in normal tasks and gets Hot after Playing graphic intensive games like COD, Genshin impact etc. 4/10 for thermal management.Who Should be getting this ? If you're okay with the average battery life and patience required for Camera fogging problem then only opt for it, that being said Overall it's a Great device Obviously but the MiUi keeps taking Toll on it's Performance now and then so more Patience required \ud83d\ude02 Sorry Mi I had to share the Reality of how amazing the phone is! but also the few problems it comes with.Thank you for Reading New Age Consumers \ud83d\ude03",

Wirless audio is good.Pros: 1. Awesome LTPO AMOLED 2k Display2. Good wirless audio on headphones and earphones.3. Good build.4. 5G Ready5. Charger is awesome. I was able to fully charge in 25 mins.6. Haptic feedback is above average, if not the best.Cons:1. Poor quality audio on quad speakers.2. Mediocre camera set up. Both videography and photography is poor.3. No Macro photography for this price is a blummer ( it is there on redmi note 10 and not on flagship).4. 2x Telephoto lens is literally useless. Niether portrait photos nor zooming capacity is hardly usable.5. Miui is buggy and bloated, even after paying 68k, you'll have some 3rd party keyboard installed, which we can not uninstalled.6. So many bloatware, for a flagship - Mi should have cleaned it up a bit.7. Worst memory management, memory leak and frequent apps crashing.8. Bugs on video apps. Example YouTube - vidoes just zooms in so much so that video is not visible at all. ( Not video zoom feature on YouTube). Even after restarting app, persists.9. Was unable to install Hotstar app from playstore. Had to finally install it from outside in the web which is not safe. ( No internet issues on wifi and 4g mobile data).10. Unavailability of accessories like. Tampered glass is so irritating. I got scratches in very 1st week on screen.11. Heats up very very badly. I'm not able to hold it for 2 mins. Hands are also heated up. Even simple task of messaging heats up heavily. It's definately a deal breaker.12. Battery drains very fast. Although topping up battery is very quick, a good respectable SOT is necessary. But drains very fast. Not a full day phone at all.If I get anymore experience, will update this. Thanks.",

Upto 5x giver better pics, 10x gives good pics, but 20x no use, gives fade pics.Other phones with 10 mp having better zoom.Main camera is INX sensor, quite good, but others are waste. Pics from main camera only are good, natural colour, quality is very good. Also having Macro mode.Batter is very small, always keep charger, charged with in 30 min. But easly drains also very fastAnd of course uts Xiaomi, Hearing issue always be there.Overall, telescope Camera and battery disappointed",

    "Review": "It's an excellent all-rounder phoneDesign: Excellent design, very premium, excellent in-hand feelDisplay: Top notch display, simply the best, the best I've seen.Charging: Amazing battery charging speed, unbelievable speed just give it 15 minutes to charge full.haptic & vibration: Vibration motor is very strong, you don't miss a call.Sound output: Very good speaker quality, it has quad speaker tuned by Harman, not too loud but sound output is best in mobiles phone.Camera: Camera is excellent day and night, fast n accurate focus, amazing details, color accurate. Natural skin tone, no noise & very pleasing camera experience. 50MP zoom camera is equally good. Ultra wide camera also click stunning pics and can take outstanding macro pics.Selfie:, No autofocus but if got the right distance images are crisp n clearBattery: Its good. getting better each passing day. Give it a time to settle, battery life increases day by day. I'm noticing improvement every day.Heating issue: first day while setting up the device due to heavy download and data transfer, it started heating and it got good enough hot. After that I've not noticed heat while browsing, navigating apps or while using camera to take pics or videos. Give it a time, it'll get better with time.Camera condensation: i tried to replicate it very hard. I tried 5 days i captured videos HD, fhd, 4k for over 10 minutes, i thought it's not in my phone. Again I've not noticed condensation while taking pics even after taking 100s of pics continuously.Capturing 8k video did a trick, after 5.5 minutes of video in 8k recording i noticed a fog which can be seen in the video also. But this fog goes away in 2-3 seconds. Not a serious issue. For normal usage we don't get it, try hard to notice the issue which will be there for 1-3 seconds. I've tried again but could not reproduce one more time, give it a try.Ads: no ads in the UI, absolutely premium flagship experience.I got 12gb/256gb varient for 51k after 8k Bank discount, it's a steal deal for the features it is offering like outstanding qhd display, unbelievable charge speed, excellent quad speaker, great front and selfie camera day n night, top notch performance. And 50w wireless charging which charges phone in 32 minutes is a great nicety I've not tried though. This is a great package for the price of it offered.Give it a time of small hiccups like heating or battery, it'll get better. Go for it if you get it in the offer below 60K",

    "Review": "So after using this for like 4-5 days after purchase :1) There is no automatic charging disconnect ion after 100% battery , it will keep you showing charging even when battery is at 100%.2) Device is bit slippery and back cover is must.3) There is a bug in camera where the reflection of Street light / Head lights are seen upside down on the display. ( Annoying bug )4) Camera quality is good, but can be improved more.5) No notification led. It has breathing pulse effect on display, but that might consume power.6) When using 2K+ resolution with 120Hz , a normal 15W charger is unable to charge battery, instead the battery keeps depleting over time. ( This needs to be fixed)7) When we press volume button to increase / decrease the intensity, the display suddenly goes very bright while the overlay is active and then reduces on its own when the volume overlay is gone.8) Don't put the 120W charger over night and sleep away ! I did smeel something burning and was worried. But seems everything was fine. Take caution about this.9) A normal 15W charger can charge the device in about 2 and half hours with FHD+ and 60Hz settings.10) Phone is a bit , might be tricky to hold the device, but it will vary depending on users.11) Gcam is supported by this device.12) Phone gets warm when intensive task are being used and games are played for long. Chances of getting it hot are higher when the device is at 2K+ and 90Hz/120Hz.13) Battery backup is overall good i will say, it needs be improved.14) Dolby Vision, Dolby Atoms, HDR10+ works fine.(HDR content supported on youtube)15) Playing music for long time on speakers will drain battery.",

The display is damn good with an excellent auto brightness calibration. Just leave it on auto3. Fast face unlock and fingerprint scanner.Works like a charm.4. Lots of customisation options.5.Weight balance is pretty good. Dosen't feel too heavy. Good inhand feel.6. Charging speed is awesome. 20 - 100 % in some 15 mins times (with boost on).7.Box packed with all the necessary accessories including a 3.5mm to Type C dongle which works pretty well.8. The price is a big factor when compared with competition.Cons:1. The battery life is a bit disappointing. Expected more from a 4600mAH unit. With the resolution turned down to FHD+ and refresh rate and brightness set to auto and regular usage (no gaming or extensive use of camera) only about 5 hrs of Screen On Time at max.2. Speaker volume is a bit too low for a dual stereo setup tuned by Harman. Its quite a bit less than my OP8T.3.Calls on loud speaker also are a bit low sounding.",

    "Review": "Review after about 2 week's usage.Looks super premium though feels a tad heavy owing to it's metallic setup near the camera.Had minor heating issues in the initial days but has been ironed out with few minor tweaks.Battery should have been 5000 mAH at this price range. After having disabled auto-start for each of the apps and changing the refresh rate to 60 Hz, able to get a battery backup of 15+hrs with average usage. 120 Watt charging does work but heats up the device which is normal though would suggest to use normal charging if the battery life is to be prolonged unless in urgent need of power.Rear camera is pretty good though the optical zoom is limited to 2x. Ultra wide capture is good enough with minimal distortion.Front camera is good when used in normal lighting, however, it brightens the image too much to ones liking when taken against a bright backdrop. Hoping for it to get resolved in the next update.Please note that I had a weird experience wherein the rear camera lens was covered with moisture trapped between the lens and protective glass cover whilst switched on for the very first time. I had to switch off the rear camera for the trapped moisture to subside after having to wait for few minutes.Has dual speakers labelled Harmon Kardon on them but has a strange echo being generated while playing few genres. I am still trying to figure it out by tweaking the equalisers.OS has minor glitches like the default apps set doesn't work as they should and the files open in MI based apps only.Overall a good buy though could have been a flagship killer had these minor glitches been ironed out.",

I have turned off unnecessary sensors, display refresh rate is reduced to 60, brightness kept to auto, dark mode. Battery is sufficient for a decent usage.

Biggest  problem : Video: 4K 60fps, recording causes camera fogging, also observed with 4K 30fls recording too. That's horrible manufacturing defect and it didnot go away even after taking 10 rounds of videos and giving rest, as suggested by someone and still continues.Also received phone with just 1 percent charge.. that means somebody used it already? repackaging and sending to others???Asked for replacement and waiting.Technician visit assigned : and it was so dumb no body turned out for the slot wasting my office time for another half day. Rescheduled and waiting.Someone has to sue Amazon and Xiaomi together for faulty sets and not replacing them easily.",

One can compare the flow of text on phones like oppo find x2 and iqoo 9 Pro and you will notice that on these phones the text and pictures bend to the sides when you scroll horizontally. But in this phone you can clearly see that it's a flat scroll!!!Connectivity over mobile network is not good in closed rooms. While the Asus rog 5 and the Oppo find x2 show upto 4 bands on the network indicator this phone goes down to 2! -95 to -100 for the Asus and the Oppo while it's -115 to -119 for the Xiaomi! That's poor!Has a good display - but not anywhere near the Oppo find x2 which is way brighter! Difficult to believe that this phone has a peak brightness of 1500 nits!Even though this is on Android 12 the miui software is not as good as color os. Recent apps can't be swiped up like in other phones, they need to be swiped to the side!Accessibility features for apps like Nova launcher etc keep getting disabled even if battery optimisation is turned off! Features like double tap to lock screen don't work, which is very bad!!!There is no option to pick colours from the wallpaper or to change the colour accent of the icons etc, which is disappointing!Finally one important point - the first phone which i received was faulty. It failed to detect the sim and used to heat up and force the user to wipe the data, and if not used to keep rebooting! Amazon replaced the phone, and the second piece is working normally. If anyone faces the same issue please inform Amazon immediately.",

    "Comment": "Showstopper Indeed! Best flagship of 2022",
    "Review": "When I first heard of the xiaomi 12 pro, I wasn't too sure whether the phone would live upto the marketing term of \"The Showstopper\"As I was pleasantly surprised, the phone indeed does live upto its reputation. Now, keep in mind that I also have a 13 pro max which is a work phone and I quite enjoyed the cameras on it especially.After getting the Xiaomi 12 Pro, I have to be honest that I haven't used my iPhone much apart from work emails and thats primarily because the camera experience has been fantastic so far. Yes, of course 50 MP resolution on all three cameras is great to have but I think we need to focus on the quality of output and this is incredibly good and consistent across all cameras not just in day light but even low light.Ultra Night Mode is a gamechanger and so is the focusing with profocus technology. No more blurry photos and you get night mode on all cameras.The display experience has also been great indoors and outdoors and I did try watching a few videos and bit of films on Netflix and the experience is amazing especially thanks to the audio. The amoled screen with dolby vision and hdr10+ is amazing but I feel the audio is one part others overlook.13 pro max is loud but the bottom speaker is louder while the top one is quite feeble. This gives equal loud output but thanks to the quad speaker with 2 woofer and 2 tweeter, Im getting better bass in music and movies also feel more immersive.Haptics are great too for gaming and typing. Performance has been great so far and I was worried about 8Gen1 as my friend has an S22 Ultra that over heats especially when gaming or using the cameras, luckily on this, no heating or issue with cameras.Charging is a lifechanger too. Had already tried 11T Pro which I got for my wife but now with this, its smarter too. Surge P1 they say is indias first intelligent charging chip, I love how fast it charges. Using boost mode I get 18-19 mins 100% from almost a flat battery but in most cases I charge my phone from 15 or 20% and this takes approx 15 mins only and unlike other flagships, they are giving the 120W charger in box. I am using the same for my Dell XPS also.Overall, I was not sure if this would be a great purchase but very happy to say that it has been amazing so far and I would definitely recommend this to others as well.",

But when i watched some YouTube videos and read some reviews on Amazon about how people are facing Fogg issues in its camera, i immediately turned on my camera and started shooting videos, and guess what?? It only took 2 minutes and a few seconds and the camera was all fogged up. This is not at all acceptable from a company charging 55000rs for a phone. I have submitted a request for exchange and i'll edit my review as soon as i get my solution on this Fogg machine.",

    "Review": "This is my first Mi phone and I had always been with Samsung till now. The phone looks premium in the blue that I purchased and the performance is awesome. But you are sure to be worried about the following when you start using it.1. Battery drains very fast. Max screen on time is about 5 hours and I rarely use cameras or play games. This happens with normal usage. I have not tried the boosted charging. Under normal charging, the 120W charger takes more than 35 minutes for a full charge.2. The virtual proximity sensor ( no physical sensor present) makes you mad during calls. Accidental mutes, calls, hold and video calls keep happening. This is a real irritant.3. Accidental touches at the edge is another frequent issue.4. Heats up mildly during calls and at times. You may be tended to move it away from face during calls, but the ear speaker is loud enough.5. No pre-applied screen guard. You need to purchase one. And I had to run around quite a few shops to get one.6. MIUI do not have separate volume control for notification and ring. If you have your ring volume high, then you would be irked by your loud notification alerts. You can set notification sound to none though.Having shared these issues, i feel happy at the awesome display and the blue back, whenever I look at it. Even the performance is quite fast. I had used it for about 6 days now. It gets me a little irritated at times but still not regretting my purchase.",

    "Review": "This is indeed a very good phone. I have always used the miui in mid range devices but using miui on this device does feel a different. It gives way more immersive experience.The display is top notch with just sooo many settings to play around with.The Audio from speakers are not very loud but definitely are rich and punchy.The cameras are really great especially the low light photography. Selfie cam though needs improvement and is not great but gcam can fix that issue.Battery life isn't that great if you are heavy user but decent enough to last whole day. The 120 watt charger is just overkill. I do not use it and charge my device with 18watt charger which charges the device in about 1hr 45 mins. I only use the stock charger when in an urgency to charge.The feel of the device is really premium though it's a Xiaomi phone. The haptics are extremely good.If your are a power user like myself who loves to play around with Custom Roms then this device is not for you since there isn't any custom rom for this device even though it's has been almost an year since this device released globally.Lastly, if you are getting this device below or at 40k just just go for it blindly. For the official price, I would rather recommend pixel 7 pro though it's little costly.",

    "Review": "Bought this phone as a gift for my dad and I\u2019m totally satisfied with my purchase.I feel what is missing these days is an all rounder smartphone and Xiaomi 12 Pro is what fills that gap. When you think about it, an overall good smartphone is made by good camera, good display and sound, and a good processor. And after using this device for a couple of days I have realized that it is great in all these aspects.Processor -  Snapdragon 8 gen 1 is the latest and the best that is out there and Xiaomi 12 Pro has it.Camera - Three cameras with 50+50+50 mp resolution is unheard of. And the result from them is equally stunning.Sound - Another thing unheard of is the quad stereo speakers the phone features and they are tuned by harman kardon. Plus it also supports Dolby atmos.Display - 2k+ amoled display, more than a billion colors, dolby vision, there\u2019s just so much here.Charging - This is another smartphone from xiaomi with 120W fast charging.Looking at all of this you can not deny how well rounded and overall achiever Xiaomi 12 pro is.",

On first sight it was a very cool looking flagship but day by day usage I'm feeling I did a biggest Mistake by buying this phone.Problems:1. Every time I closing all apps and coming to home screen it's showing a loading screen for almost 10 sec which I am not seen in my old K20 pro.2.Tge mobile is heating like a hell while playing a very lite game.3.battery charging really fast and draining faster than that.4.Camera app strucking badly while recording a video.Recorded video looks like old VGA camera video.5.\"Get apps\" app from miui downloading unwanted apps like moj again and again.There is no option to stop this and uninstall the \"Get apps\" app.6.Some apps are crashing frequently.7.finger print sensor not that fast.8.There are so Many bugs in this phone and Xiaomi not yet given a single update to fix this. The only thing I like in this mobile is the sound quality from the outspeaker.That's all I got from \u20b960,000 flagship.I have been a fan of Xiaomi from 2015 but Xiaomi lost my trust now.  I made a big mistake I should go for one plus or Google pixel.",

Thanks to Amazon service that my return process was reasonably smooth. Awaiting refund which is already initiated.Experience may vary from user to user. Would recommend OnePlus 10Pro over this phone for some more extra bucks.",

Battery backup is very good when in WiFi and FHD, it's average when in QHD and in mobile data. Excellent design and gorgeous curves, and oozes premiumness, Haptic engine is great, flagship processor and Ram so buttery smooth also 120hz takes it to next level, MIUI13 is clean here and no adds and works like a charm, in simple everything is maxed out. you get true flagship experience similar to S22 ultra.",

    "Review": "Overall the phone is great with beautiful display great inhand feel great haptics. But the battery life in my 4 day usage is average. I don't know if this will be fixed via updates or not but till now it's not very good. I had a 4000 mah phone  last and it lasted thr same as this maybe it's because of the processor or thr refresh rate but it should be improved via updates. Other than that the phone's really great and if you are an average user the battery will last the whole day easily so not so bad either. I don't use cameras that much so can't really comment on that but so far looks really good and the limited photos I have clicked have come out great. The couture blue color I bought looks premium and classy too but if you have the option go for the mauve one.P.S: The delivery by the Amazon courier really sucks and took 5 days to arrive from a destination just 5 hours away from my location. And took more than a day to deliver from the warehouse nearby.",

There is nothing you can do about it.Don't waste your money.Camera is good.Charger and charging speed is quite impressive.Charges 0 to 100 in 30-35 minutes.",

    "Review": "Here is my honest review after 3 days of usage.Got it at a price of 42K+ with an exchange and card discount. Excellent device with features at this price.1) Camera - Awesome pictures with details during daylight conditions. I haven't tried night pics till now but it somewhat struggled in indoor pub lighting with Palco and spotlights of various colors. Selfie camera is average at best. Overall 8.5 out of 10.2) Display - Awesome clarity and excellent for content viewing. Overall 10 out of 103) Performance - Excellent. I am not a gamer but day-to-day activities work flawlessly. Overall 9 out of 104) MIUI - Much improved this time with MIUI 13. Didn't see any small bugs which were visible in my earlier Redmi device. There is of course room for improvement. I have used MIUI for long so doesn't matter to me anymore. The phone still running on the March update so Xiaomi needs to work on the update policy since it's a flagship.5) Battery - This is where it struggles. Didn't get a full day backup with moderate to heavy usage like photography, youtube videos, calling, etc in the highest setting i.e QHD+ and 120Hz refresh rate. The 120-watt charger makes up for this disappointing battery life. Hope Xiaomi resolves it with a software update. Haven't faced any heating issues yet with normal charging mode but it gets slightly warm. Overall 6 out of 10.6) Speakers - Decent but could have been a bit louder. Overall 8.5 out of 10.Pros - Rear camera, display, Fast charging, day-to-day performance, features.Cons - Bad battery backup, selfie camera, lack of IP ratingIf you can ignore a few cons then it is an excellent device for the price point of 53K (including offers). You can save an additional amount with an exchange of an old device. Recommended with conditions apply.",

    "Comment": "Guys think again before buying this !!!",
    "Review": "I bought this phone over iQOO 9 Pro, considering many facts like price, configuration,120w charging in 18 minutes, camera, sound etc. I got disappointed by charging technology as it requires boost to 120w charging, an option only available when your phone is powered on and during 120w charging phone heats up alot, goes up to 46\u00b0- 47\u00b0 C. When phone is down to 0% and turned off then charging takes 45-50 minutes to charge fully. I have used iQOO 7 Legend with 120w charger and it doesn't require any extra boost. One more thing which Xiaomi hasn't introduced in any of the phones is over charge protection, unlike Vivo or Oppo who ship every phone equipped with over charge protection.Another problem is the battery which gets drained very fast, battery endurance is close to 9-10 hours, if you need to raise it then bring down refresh rate to 60Hz, use Full HD resolution, turn off location and feel like using a phone which doesn't have these options.These are the reasons Xiaomi is offering a discount of up to 10k on this phone, people aren't saving 10k, they are wasting 50-60k rather.",

    "Review": "Average battery life. 5 hours SOT, no matter what you do. This the worst part of the phone. But here is what I and few other users are doing to get 8 hours of SOT. Turn off location, bluetooth, keep the display at FHD+ resolution, 90 hertz.Main camera is good, selfie is below average for this price, gcam is good for selfies but need a proper configuration for gcam to make selfies better.Miui is a personal preference, I don't like miui cause we can't use play store icon packs. But the stand-by battery usage on miui is just great.Bootloader unlocking and safety from bricking is good with xiaomi.Screen is good, accidental touches are there though(use a case/cover to get rid of them).Indian variant doesn't come with pre-installed screen guard. Other countries get pre-installed screen guard for xiaomi 12 pro.Speaker quality is good. Haptics are good too.Overall 4 stars for default product but 5 stars after tweaking.",

Snapdragon 8 gem 1 processer doing very well...Camera quality is very good...if u take pics of distant objects u can use its tephoto lense which is also 50 mp and 2x optical zoom...u will get a good quality image without loss pixels...Wide angle camera is only 120 degre..it should have 140 to 150 degre wide..But selfie camera performance disappointed me..it is bad and never except from a flagship phone...hope that Xiaomi will improve this on next software update...",

If you will start using while charging..it will take hours to charge. Even if your phone's screen is on..it will take almost 3 hour to charge 100%. I tested it with screen time always on. And Yess..phone heats a lot. Really lot. The kind of performance IQOO9 pro gives is unmatchable and its charging is super good with PD 120W, which is next level.So, I will suggest to go with this(IQOO9) phone.",

Lasting 2 Days. Camera Is Good And Have More Features But Not Better Than A Samsung Phones Camera.Didnt Face Any Fogging Issue In Camera Lense Like Many Others. There Is A Little Bit Heating But Way Too Less Compared To My Samsung Note 9 So I Dont Even Feel It.The Only Thing I Dont Like Is That I Am Not Able To Change Screenshot Format To PNG From JPEG.

After playing hours of BGMI, Genshin impact this phone doesn't showing any lag or hiccups in between the entire play session. Let me point out the likes and dislikes of this phone.Likes:1.Powerful Qualcomm 8gen 1 chipset with balanced kernel tuning from Mi\ud83d\ude0e.2. Fabulous \u2764\ufe0f Amoled display with faster finger print scanner but not the best\ud83d\ude11.3. 120w Fast charging i hope it doesn't blast my phone \ud83d\ude014. Camera's are fantastic but Mi needs to tinker more on this area cuz with this camera setup this device can perform better with tweaked native camera. In that case, am happy with my gcam mod.5. The stereo speaker system with inbuilt woofer arrangement sounds too good.Dislikes:1. Felt bulky sometimes may be due to the fact that it's an 6.73 inch 2k display.2. Heavily customised ROM, affects smoother user experience.3. Worried about True Battery cycle, considering the fact the faster you charge your phone faster it looses the truly designed battery Capacity.4. RAM's aren't too expensive these days, since New SOC and Modems are expensive these days. Flagship like this should be launched with 12gb RAM in the base variant itself. And looting \u20b94000 bucks from potential buyers for an extra 4gb RAM is unacceptable, and Xiaomi should admit that Mi phones do need more RAM cuz of their heavily skinned Android ROM.",

    "Review": "The Xiaomi 12 Pro is the company's most premium offering yet for 2022 and Xiaomi has taken a slightly different approach with it. Rather than simply pushing for the biggest numbers on a specs page like it did with the 11 Ultra, Xiaomi claims it has focused more on consistency while still packing enough premium features to justify the price. A quick look at the specs reveals the usual suspects in terms of hardware, but the quad-speaker setup in the Xiaomi 12 Pro is certainly unique and not something we've seen in any flagship phone in India.",

    "Review": "After waiting from  FEb_2022 ,Finally I have decided to go for it as this phone have all most all Flagship specifications you need in today's competition era...where every week you find new phone is launching.*Display is 10 /10 it's impressive and Brightness is 1700 nits (max) ,Supports HDR+, you have both option to run on FHD+ and WHD + ,it's too beautiful with live wallpapers. I bet you will not put phone down .* Sound is mind-blowing ,what we need stereo speakers and this time Xiaomi Given 4 speakers ,2 tweeter and 2 woofers.*Calling quality is too crispy ,even on 2 tower signal of Airtel ,I able to here clear and loud sound.* Miui 13 is Impressive version , you have unlimited choices of Live wall papers...Theme...Ringtones. Fontswith very less bloat applications. Even many of unwanted application which is pre-installed ,you can  easily uninstall.*Charging is too fast. Battery stays  it takes less then 25 minutes from 10 to 100 % chargingand it's goes for  1.5 days ,in normal conditions without playing game.*Camera is also promising ..though I have not taken too many pictures* Processor is flagship 8 SOC gen 1 Snapdragon.So, at this rate this is far better for all competitors available on 8 SOC gen 1.Just close your eyes and press \"Buy Now\" , you will be more then satisfied .Only IP68 rating is not there ,but other competitors are also not have recently launched in last 2 months , except S22 ultra.and that not make sense to pay 1 lakh for phone when you have all features in just half of price in Xiaomi 12 pro.",

    "Review": "I am using 12 pro since 1 week and here is my honest review:It has good display but again the curve is just an minic as this is not that curved display. The curved side buzzel are black and it is not display.The front display is said be protected by victus glass but it can get easy scratches if you put in pocket with any key or something like it.Battery life is Avg. It will last 1 day but if you are heavy user like games or streaming media then need to charge twice.Mi UI 13 is good.Camera performance is quite good but it not upto mark. It has 50 MP telephoto camera but give just 2x zoom which is not Good.Sound quality is good but speaker are avg. In loudness. The headphones supported by aptx technology so that are awesome.So to sum up if you spending 50k money then you need to look for others option too. It is not worth of money.",

I love Xiaomi as a company for their low margins and how they bring innovative and exciting products to market. The last phone I had was a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ and I wasn't as happy as I was with it than I am with this one.Mi 12 Pro is amazing in all the aspects. I love MIUI and the small quality of life improvements it brings. I hate that the dialer and messaging app has been replaced with Google apps which is a huge bummer because I just love how MIUI designs apps.Great device for your money, period!",

    "Comment": "Primary Camera lens condensation (fogging)",
    "Review": "I received my phone on 29th of September and before that i saw everywhere online which includes websites, YouTube channels and even on reddit as well as Twitter that there is a problem with this phone's primary camera. Even while recording a normal video the phone's primary lena starts getting fog or condensation. It started after 2-3minutes. I tried it in a colder environment as well as in a hot environment which is outside home and indoors in both situation without Air conditioning and with air conditioning on but the problem still persists. It is a bad experience that the main feature for which Xiaomi is saying this as one of their best flagship phone with best camera's have this big problem and this is faced by everyone means now i don't understand should I get a replacement or return the product or keep it and wait for a software update or a fix. I'll be visiting the service centre and ask them for a fix or a solution. I think it is a advice how much the phone is good in terms of specifications but i would request people to avoid buying the phone till Xiaomi tries to get this problem fixed.",

    "Review": "Pros:1. Awesome display, Netflix HDR is supported and with video toolbox you can enable HDR effect on all video players and it looks absolutely stunning. 2K upscaling, smooth frame rate features also supported for videos.2. Very good cameras. The stock camera app captures good quality images. With a proper gcam it can beat pixel 6 pro imo.3. Speakers are okay. One thing with earpiece, I have noticed that with Airtel sim the volume is low but with Jio it's very loud and clear. Issues with Airtel maybe.4. It's an Android Enterprise recommended device so you can setup work profile securely.5. IR remote has become underrated, but it is really useful if you travel a lot.Neutral:1. Based on reviews I thought battery would be very bad but to my surprise it gives about 7-8 hours SoT from 100-1% (after debloating ofcourse). In comparison other 4500 mAh batteries from other brands give 6 hr SoT. And the 120W charging is there for quick 20 mins full charge. So no issues there.Cons:1. MIUI India version is not properly optimized yet. Can be fixed with software updates.2. Not a lot of authentic UV tempered glasses are available. Searching for one is a real hassle. You can get one from local market but make sure it fits perfectly.",

    "Review": "So far good.,I'm switching from 8 years of OnePlus experience to MiUi., Definitely hard. Initially my mind didn't allow to like MiUi., But slowly getting there with help of themes, Nova launcher, lot of customisation changes.I bought this 12 Pro for only reason - Camera.Only 2 days so far, didn't test it much, but I can say it's definitely capable. I'll update this review definitely with more samples. That rose click was in extreme day light condition, handled we it seems. And the Jasmine white petals are also good., Trying my luck with fish - definitely need to click more shots to get a perfect one.Heats normally as any SD (not 8gen1, just like any SD - it also heats). Didn't play hardcore games, but while using Camera for more than 30 mins definitely heated up the device, but it's normal imo. And also it's 1st day, system definitely need sometime to adjust. And also it's damn hot here in coastal summer.According to the Performance - it's fast, smooth etc., But that's not my primary req - because I'm still happy with OP6.Display is great. Glass design is lovely. Battery seems to suck asusual. I didn't turn on that boost charge mode, I never need it i guess.",

Gives 5 to 5.5hrs screen on time max. If you use intensive apps then just 4hrs.The only major issue I'm facing is that Android auto doesn't work with 75% of cables including the one given by xiaomi. It connects with oneplus dart cable but Android auto disconnects as soon as screen goes off.",

The battery when compared to my Redmi Note 8 Pro, is not up to the mark though charging is super fast. The display under sunlight is pathetic. Just can't see anything in outdoors, with a decent level of brightness I normally use. USB C to 3.5mm jack again is not comfortable to use. Jio mobile data is received comparably slower than my previous Note 8 pro. should have delayed my purchase...",

    "Review": "Let's look for the pros and cons post using the phone for 6 months:Pros first:1. Charging: exceptional charging speed, you don't need to worry about charging or waiting just brush your teeth and get your coffee and the phone is ready from 0-100.2. Screen Display: Display quality is good and you can watch full HD videos without any pixel distortion3. Touch response: much better than many phones you find out but not exceptional given the price rangeNow coming to cons:1. Camera: even after claiming tri-50MP cam at the back the picture quality is okay if not poor. Though daylight pictures are still good. Night mode just brightens up the background nothing else. Also after a use of 6 months the picture quality has also degraded2. System Performance: well, I hoped that this wouldn't be your typical Xiaomi but alas it is. It hangs!! It hangs like crazy!! Xiaomi need to work a lot to get their phone's steady. You can't have a flagship over 55k+ and still getting hanged a lot.3. Brand appearance: although you would buy a high end expensive phone still it won't give you the feel with \"Xiaomi\".Overall, not a flagship I would recommend at the price given the options available. Choose wisely!",

    "Review": "Got it at 33k.. initial impression was really good but after installing some games and trying out benchmarking application. It started showing what others are experiencing. On running AnTuTu benchmark, CPU temperature even cross 72\u00b0C which is insane and with it you can fry egg and also battery temperature always stays around 45-53\u00b0C during the test which really bothers me. In CPU throttling test, it runs pretty stable but scored like mid range processor. While gaming too, it heats a lot and the side metal frame is uncomfortably hot to the touch.Not only these, there Camera fog formation while recording videos. Sometimes it appears, sometimes don't.The same issues persist on the replaced device too.Month & Year of manufacturing : April | 2022",

Value for money. Non other can match price to factor. Xiaomi 12 Pro is one of the best devices. Trust me you will be very happy for all performance and display the sound quality amazed. Just MIUI needs little refined. It's not bad it's best. Go ahead. Great Phone.",

    "Review": "I thought it would be difficult to switch from iPhone to Xiaomi or ios to Android but I must say that it was a good decision.This phone is truly a flagship killer and do justice to it's price of 55-60k.Pros:It will be worth noting the flagship features I like are it's cristal clear 2k amoled display, beautifully designed curved edges, latest snapd 8 gen 1 professor, fastest charging ever on any smartphone, best haptic sensor, crazily functional and easy to use Mi user interfaceinterface. Best Camera's which takes natural looking images in most of the conditions and last but not the least it's beautiful design which feels up market.Cons: While shooting a video in 1080p or 4k resolution, phone does get overheated.I didn't see any heating issues in my device. It gets warm while charging which is common with fast charging, metal body or high end processors.I really recommend this phone if your budget is between 55k-65k. This device from Xiaomi won't disappoint you in any point of time. Thanks!",

I need to turn off the wifi and blutooth to talk to other person on phone app;It could be fixed in next update i hope;Overall this Xiaomi 12 pro does meet my expectations;Easter: if you add pubg/cod to game turbo, while playing with friends or in multiplayer you can change your voice with inbuilt options ;)",

Below are my thoughts on the phoneLooks dammm Gorgeous and hand feel is so good. Minimalistic-ally premium. Display is crisp and delight to use and watch content. While SD8Gen1 is infamous for heating, I personally didn\u2019t face any heating issues nor any lags/ stutter while playing CoD, asphalt. Multitasking is smooth.. Thing that appealed to me most is the Camera. Consistent output from all 3 50MP cameras. Takes absolutely flawless images in almost all scenarios. Especially Low light performance is just top notch. I use wireless charging most of the times, works well. Wired charging charges from around 10-100% in approx 15 minutes.I like my phone to look good and one that gives me flawless usage experience. Most importantly, have great set of Cameras. And Xiaomi 12 pro delivers it all. Great offers made the deal even sweeter.",

    "Review": "Received very prompt delivery from Amazon!The phone genuinely looks like a flagship with glass back, metal frame & premium camera setup. The finish on my black color variant also looks & feels great. Performance wise also it seems top notch. I have been playing some games from the last couple of days and I haven't observed any lag or heating. But the one thing that stands out for me is the multimedia experience on this phone. Clarity and picture quality is amazing, when paired with the great acoustics the overall experience is lifelike.Camera also performs good & the pictures in ultra night mode are truly superior.My one small complaint would be that this phone feels a little slippery in hand, so I need to be a little cautious if I am not using the protective case.Otherwise, it is a very good phone packed with all the latest features & Android 12.  Highly recommend this device to people looking for flagship phones.",

Design and build wise it's something unique you can rarely seen...good design and build.5.

Image quality is also not good.5-There is no GCam with proper config to use as alternate option.If there is issue with storage can go for Moto edge 30 Ultra.

    "Review": "First of all, the phone packs an absolute beast of a camera setup. Be it low light conditions, difficult light conditions with background light, or just plain human portraits, the camera just nails it. I am in absolute love with the cameras. The next best thing is the display and sound, gorgeous display and the sound is so clear. Having moved from Pixel myself, I can feel the difference in the multimedia experience. It takes some getting used to MiUI after having moved from Pixel, but as of everything feels quite seamless. The design is minimalistic, yet elegant. The texture does feel like velvet matte finish and there's just the right amount of texture that helps grip the phone better.I feel the phone would have been almost perfect had it come with an IP68 rating, but that's passable. Overall extremely happy with the phone.",

Imust say the in hand feel of Xiaomi 12 Pro is awesome and rounded corners with thecurved display just completes this experience. With three 50 MP cameras, I think Xiaomi12 Pro has the best camera output. It runs on the best industry has to offer that isSnapdragon 8 gen- 1 and android 12 out of the box. I am happy with my choice and willrecommend everyone to consider this whose priority are design and camera.",

    "Review": "Display, speed, quality, camera, etc. --  everything is top notch. Far better than we can imagine.But, battery is utterly disappointing. I do not play games or run software tests. My usage is akin to an average mobile user - surfing net, apps, yt, etc. Even for this average usage, if we charge to full in morning, the charging drops to less than 30% by eve. If a little more is done, phone gets heated up quickly. This, with all optimisations checked.So I feel the specs are beautiful, camera unparalleled, but but the phone has got not enough energy to fulfil those specs for longer duration. If not for heating issue at normal usage and battery drain even after optimisations (viz.; 60hz, fhd, etc) makes this buy to have mixed feelings.",

The metalcamera module and the velvet matte finish back feels just amazing in hand.I have been using a galaxy s10 edge prior to this and upgrading to this phone has beenan amazing experience. From initial impressions, the 2k AMOLED display is great. Havewatched a couple of movies on Netflix and Hotstar and the Dolby vision support justmakes the whole experience so wholesome. The camera just takes breathtaking nightshots, especially the auto-focus capabilities of this device is too good. The brand is alsogiving a 120W charger in box which is a good news these days, when other brands areshipping phones without chargers in box.",

    "Review": "Using since June 23rd 2022. Got it for 56749/- with all offers applied and no exchange.PROs: One of the best cameras in this range. The photos are great and different camera modes work as expected.  Great battery experience even though battery is somewhat underpowered as the charging is superfast with the bundled charger. Never faced a low battery situation. Screen is a delight to look at. 2k videos are a feast for your eyes on this display. Processor is great and handles multitasking like a breeze.CONs : phone heats up perceptibly. However biggest con is the OS. UI is horrible, buggy as hell. ONCE I EVEN HAD MY TOUCHSCREEN FROZEN. COULD NOT ACCESS ANYTHING AND HAD TO DO A HARD REBOOT ON A FLAGSHIP PHONE WITHIN A MONTH OF PURCHASE. This phone is unpredictable. STAY AWAY IF YOU DEPEND ON YOUR PHONE FOR A LOT OF YOUR WORK. GREAT AS A LEISURE DEVICE ONLY. When it works, it's a smooth experience. When it doesn't, you will regret the day you decided to buy it.",

    "Review": "There are no complaints and the phone was delivered within a day...I've been using this gadget for the last 2 days now, and I believe the following make it a great purchase1. Excellent display, screen, and overall feel. The phone feels amazing in the hand and does not feel heavy and bulky like other phones that generally are.2. The camera and color balance are unquestionably superior to prior devices I\u2019ve owned (Oneplus 5 and Samsung S20FE).3. SD 8 gen 1 makes navigating the phone a breeze4. The In Display fingerprint sensor is extremely fast and responsive.5. The sound quality is outstanding. It does make it stand apart from other devices.6. MIUI 13 is excellent and has come a long way from its days of the past.",

Xiaomi 12 pro In selfie mode doesn't hav AI option which is even available in every budget phone now days. Worse Selfie Camera don't be missguided with 32 mega pixal tag of this Xiaomi 12 pro.2) Heating issue , even after use of large vapour chembur (according to company) it produced hudge Heat, specially up side right corner of back cover where mother board MAIN Chip-set snap dragon is fitted , onother hand With same chip One plus 10 T doesn't produced such hudge heat.3 ) with Dual stereo Dobly sound speakers which is tuned by Harmon carton, sound quantity is good but not Load enough. So what is benefit od dual speakers.4) 50 mp Main secondry camera has also lot of issue which is it becomes smoky or Fogg while shooting 8k video , mainy users also complaint about it in ultra slow video. In AC ROOMS or in clod weather it's main camera becomes foggy don't no why . Worse experience . Display is only good thing in this phone.",

Devise is slightly slimmed and curved edges are attractive. Charger is heavy to carry. I should have thought twice before buying!!!!",

I tested the devices primarily in three departments:Battery: As usual, I deliberately drained the battery completely for the first time to test how long it actually takes to get fully charged and was amazed to see that it actually got charged to 98% in 18 mins, which is truly amazing.Camera: Was excited to see that the pictures on this are very close to DSLR quality, especially the photos in the dark and the portraits are excellent.Sound: Was listening to music to check if the quad speakers make any significant difference.Overall this is an amazing device and totally worth the amount I spent on it. Really amazed by the device performance and satisfied with my purchase.",

I liked theback glass finish.Second checkbox camera, here we get a triple 50MP camera. With XIaomi\u2019s softwareoptimization we get the best and consistent output.Third checkbox is battery and charging:- Here Xiaomi gives 120Watt charger in the box sowe get to 100% charge in a fraction of an hour and the 4600Mah battery gives you a fullday battery life.The final checkbox is processor, here we get the top of the line Qualcomm Snapdragon 8Gen-1, all the latest game runs smoothly and doing multitasking is also never a problem.",

No steps from Xiaomi to address this issue. So called warranty don't cover you for such an obvious manufacturing defect. there should be recall for this model. stay away. not worth even half the price",

Tried playing racing and shooting games for two hours in one go and I was glad that the phone had hardly heated, thanks to the latest processor \u2013 Snapdragon 8Gen 1.  In addition to this, I took pictures from all the three 50 MP lens: Wide, Ultra wide and telephoto and was delighted to see that the images are of top notch Quality. I would definitely recommend this to all those who are looking for a phone with amazing camera and superb gaming experiences as I am completely satisfied with the performance.",

The camera quality taken on the main 50 MP lens is excellent, better than iPhone 13 Pro and Samsung S20 - 21 series. Selfies are excellent. Good phone for social media platforms.Downsides: (1) Macro lens is not available, (2) Telephoto lens is weak, (3) Curved glass cannot be protected by conventional screen guards, and (4) the camera bump is big.",

Excellent camera proly the best in any flagship phones for this price except professionals who will always find some of the other issue.Good design but phone is slightly on the heavier side. Speakers both way give wonderful sound output and curved display having its own advantages. A great phone to take on one plus and Vivo, iq with awesome snapdragon gen 1 processor.",

    "Review": "Such a pathetic phone. Phone heats up a lot and due to this when its a cooler weather outside or hunidity is high, the camera lens start collecting condensation or fog inside within 5 to 7 monutes. After that camera is worse than 2k phone camera. Wifi download is so slow, it takes 15 minutes to download 35 mb data. Its like dial up of old days. And the battery drains so quickly that if you use best display setting, the battery drops 18 % in 30 minutes.And after all this you want to return/replace the phone, they play games by installing simplistic app minspect that does not capture camera fog collecting after 5 minutes and that does not take into consideration the temperature difference between a heated up phone and cooler humid weather and its affect on camera lens. It a pathetic pathetic experience purchasing from amazon that makes it purposfully hard to replace or return the phone and pathetic chinese company that rolled put a phone without proper testing and with poorest quality control. Now the almost 50k is wasted on this phone with which tou can not take photos in costal area which is generally humid or in colder places b3cause the phone inside is hot and lens is fogging up due to temperature difference. At this point consumer court seems the only way.",

    "Review": "I bought this phone only by looking at the brilliant camera specs, but this has been my worst nightmare ever. While the photo output from the main camera is exeptional, there is a terrible disaster while shooting video- the main lens gets a lot of fog (condensation) in just a minute or two. I tried every possible tricks available in comment and internet, but the result is the same. I don't expect this issue in a phone for which I spent almost 55K.Also, the phone gets hot like an oven when charging. Even normal tasks like speaking over phone for about 20 minutes and photographing makes this device very hot, all thanks to the flagship Snapdragon processor.There's one more issue. The reception capabilities of this device is far worse when compared to realme or samsung.Rest- design and other performance are good. If you don't shoot video or not interested in photography, you may go with this phone.",

Big Issue: You Can't record video at a stretch for more than 3 or 4 minutes. FOG condensation in the main Lens. How is that even possible on a 2022 ( Fake )Flagship phone is beyond me.AVOID this Phone. Avoid. If somehow it is priced below 20K then it is ok. Avoid. Sold my phone. Thank god.",

Specially the supermoon mode and other vlog mode.Decent phone so far still exploring the phone features.Got this additional 10,000 instant discount along with no cost which is a steal deal for this beast.Battery should have been little better otherwise overall great flagship phone.",

I never have to worry aboutmy battery life as just a short 10 minute top up provides a day\u2019s worth of battery.Other notable features like the attention paid to the Display and Sound make a hugedifference in day to day life and are appreciable over the life of the product.Pro focus has helped me never miss a shot of my active children. I would wholeheartedlyrecommend the product.",

Ever since I made a purchase I am facing this issue of screen flickering during incoming call. Once this happens the contacts will disappear from your phone. I am forced to restart my mobile 3 or 4 times daily as a work around.Many said mi / redmi is not worth for more than 20k INR. Now I am realizing it strong. I have wasted 47K on this xiomi 12 pro. Though xiomi is superior than redmi if someone say. Please understand miui is common for all phones.I just came to know that Xiomi already know about the issue and not fixing the software problem on their brands.",

    "Review": "Edit:DO NOT buy this, it has a major camera problem. None of the reviewers say this as all are paid :) The camera lens gets water sweats after like 2 mins of usage. Check youtube for camera fog in Xiaomi 12 Pro camera.Never buy this expensive device from Xiaomi, its a budget phone making company, i was a fool!Original review:1. Buy a powerbank first \ud83e\udd72, you will need it!2. Great camera, with latest Gcam support3. Bad selfie camera (especially against the light)4. Speaker quality is great, but not loud5. Call reception problem sometimes6. Great display7. 120W is a gimmick, kinda, u need in-box charger and cable to use, so either carry them always or you have a phone with a bad battery!Honestly only go for this if you need a less expensive flagship with great back camera. No other useful flagship feature!",

Blazing fast , runs like charm5. Charging is extremely fastCons1. Battery life is pathetic - very poor battery backup, doesn't even last half a day2. Camera has major issue with its primary lens - while shooting videos after 1 or 2 minutes camera lens gets foggy from inside , this is a manufacturing defect because of poor quality control of Xiaomi. They replace the phone but replacement phone also has the same issue. Its a know defect in the phone",

It takes 18-20 mins to charge from 1-100 percent in boost mode and 27-30 mins to charge from 1-100 in normal mode.5. Speaker output is good, but not loud. (Can be a con if you like loud).Cons:1. Heating issue is a concern.2. Camera is above average, nothing spectacular to say the least.3. Fingerprint scanner works 6/10 times on an average and is a bit slow.I would say, this is a good option to consider if you get it for around 40-45k including the exchanges and other offers.",

If you want better battery backup by phones like galaxy a73 which has sd778 these are more power efficient chipsets.",

It also depends on ambience temperature.Battery is good, not the best. You ll get by one day with ease, but needs more software optimisations.All in all a great buy and happy with the product.",

Not sure phone software issue or apps issue.4. Stereo speakers not that much loud. But it's good. If More loud more changes of getting damaged.5. Lot of noise seen in the picture quality when the subject is zoomed much. Similarly during nightmode.Pros:1. Main camera is out of the world.2. Speed is lightning3. Apps opens much faster.4. So many in built video and photo modes.5. Premium looks6. Superb audio quality.7. Charges very fast via 120w  charger.8. Photos and vedio quality are amazing.",

    "Review": "Listing out the cons as this is a premium expensive top of the line phone and should have taken care of below aspects:1) Optical fingerprint reader - It is slow and because it is optical, the screen needs to shine a bright light on the sensor - this hurts the eyes in night.2) Speakers are mediocre - They toute the phone as having 4 separate speakers - the sound is muddy and mediocre.3) Screen WILL hurt your eyes in the night, it doesnt dim enough and there is enough flicker for you to lose sleep and have visions if you use it in the dark4) Curved edge screens are wasteful, have a tint at the edge and you will have aberrations at the edges5) It has a terrible handfeel on the back panel. It is matte, powdery like feeling that will ensure the phone will slip out of the hand. Even the glassy screen has much better grip than the back panel. The edge also is slippery - this is just a poor design",

After about 4-5 minute of the video you will see the video getting blurred and the fog getting collected. So you will have shut your phone for the fog to disappear. I got the 1st device replaced but when I checked the replacement I got it also had the same issue. I'm really disappointed with Xiaomi on this so called \"Show Stopper\" well it's more a \"Camera Fogger\" . Those people who have this try making a 4k 60fps video for 5 - 10 minutes.

I got only till July.2) camera fogging- as soon as we start video in 4K@60fps, we can see camera fogging up in a minute. There by leaving blur video. What's the use of 50+50+50 camera when hardware itself has no proper sealing. It is not IP rated. That shows there are issues with sealing though nothing is evident to our naked eye.3) heating can be seen when video camera is switched on. I don't play games on phone, so I don't know heating due to gaming.I am not a videographer or more interested in it. So camera fogging is not a major issue for my usage. My main purposes are social media and ott content watching. For that, your job will be perfectly done by this phone with out any heating issues. Hope through software updates, battery also lasts more. Charging is superfast. Within 20 min, phone charges to 100%. If anyone wants to buy this phone for camera, I don't suggest them. Better get iPhone or Vivo X80 pro. If u r getting this phone at 40k minus, go for it, else forget about it. That feeling of defective camera don't patch well with our mind. So the premium experience and quality takes a hit at some point. Will update any interesting or worth mentioning facts soon.",

    "Review": "Brought this phone on Diwali sale and grap the deal in 39k. Under 40k it's a great phone and there is no competitors even one plus 10 pro which is around 60k.Before buying I go through with so many reviews at Amazon as well on Flipkart. There is one main problem and that was Fog issue in main 50MP camera while making videos. But after using almost 10 day as my primary phone I didn't get Fog issue in my phone even making videos in 8k.Pro-1. Camera is one of the best part. Images that was taken in night is awesome.2. Curved 2k Display impressive.3. Fingerprint sensor works fine.4. No hanging and lagging issue thanks to snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor.5. 120 W Troubo charger. It's really charge phone from 0 to 100% within 20 mins if you activate the boost mode otherwise it take 40 to 45 mins to get fully charged.Cons1. There is Heating issue as we all know that 8 Gen 1 processor is power hungry and phone get heated up if you play PUBG/COD in it higher graphics for more than 2 hrs. But it cool off soon also if you place your phone ideal for 5 to 10 min.2. Battery drain fast it give max 5hrs 30 min of screen on time. But that was not my concern because you can get the phone fully charged within 20 mins. Thanks to 120W charger that's come with in the box.",

I had to take the phone to the service center at my own cost. They offered a replacement phone after 10 days which again was not working out of box. and since then it has been 20 days I have been running behind them to either give my money back of replace the phone. They just keep escalation and nothing else happens.If your budget is above 50K better go for a branded phone (Samsung/Apple). These duplicates just sound value for money on papers.",

    "Review": "I am using this phone from last 4 days and Buddy  i'll say, It is an amazing phone which you can buy under 70k. The best part of the phone is the \"camera\" and the \"display\". If you are want to buy a camera phone under 70k trust me you'll not disappoint. Lots of people were saying that this phone heat like fire, But till now i have not found any heating issue in mi 12 pro. But there is something which i have not like about this phone. First the camera bump is very huge. It could have been low, But its not. And the second thing is the battery backup. Personally i am not happy with its battery backup. You can stretch the battery between 24 to 48 hours. But again if you have that 120W super fast charger then, I don't think you will face any issues. It does get 100% charged in just 21 min. Overall i'll say this is an amazing phone in terms of camera, display, and design also its looks very perimium.",

Earlier when I transferred the apps from my previous android phone may be some settings were also copied which was causing several issues with the apps. Now everything sorted out and working like true flagship, very happy. Battery life also getting sufficient.--------------------------------------------------------Purchased during the launch period with 10K discount. Battery life not great but covering almost a full day with my type of use. Standby time excellent, if you just put the phone with wifi/data on and doing nothing there is hardly any battery loss even for hours. And even for heavy use if battery goes down there is superfast charger to support, will make it 100% withing 20mins. Camera which is the main USP is very good along with Supermoon mode. Would be good if there was a macro camera and mode.Main problem I am facing with the new android 12 version. Many apps are not working properly. Waiting for some fix to come at earliest.",

    "Review": "The mobile is good but not up to the mark, not worthy for 60k.Pros: Display, rear camera are good. Charging is too fast. Selfie camera is okay type . Feel good factor is there.looks attractive, eye catching, definitely somebody will ask you about the phone from its style.Cons: battery drains rapidly. Even a 15 k mobile lasts better. Forget about iPhone,it even lasts less than OnePlus 6 ,which I was using since last 4yr. Even after 4yrs of using managed to get on screen time of 4hr...but with this phone i only get 4.30 hr of screen time with moderate uses i.e only surfing social media and watching YouTube and reading through Adobe and that too with FHD+ ,60 hz. I m not a gamer. If camera is used phone heats up badly...u can iron your shirt/pants. Even with other moderate uses the phone heats up easily. Didn't expect it from a flagship phone.Compared it with mi 11 X which has 4500 mAh battery, but that phone lasts good. With similar uses, similar onscreen time , that phone drained around 20% battery and this mi 12 pro phone drained 40%. Whether it is poor optimization or a bug or due to the display it drains faster,i don't know but battery is not good. Even while typing this comment the phone drained 3% battery. Hope it can be fixed someday if there is a bug.",

    "Review": "The phone has a one of the Best 50MP Sony IMX707 Sensor cameras n an E5 AMOLED 2K display with a 3200 by 1440-pixel resolution at 522 PPI but the battery charging is not as advertised, not completed in 18 Mins, Smart 120W Xiaomi HyperCharge takes around 30-40 mins to charge fully, 4600mAh battery capacity is the least for this Beast. U need a power Bank...... The quad-speaker stereo sound output of the phone speaker is good but not the best. The Colour Opera Mauve is a Trap it's not that. Am totally fooled by the color.Samsung S series users will not find MIUI that easy and will also miss bixby voice command. But the Latest Snapdragon\u00ae 8 Gen 1 processor n the Latest 12 GB LPDDR5 RAM + 258 GB UFS 3.1 storage is a Boom. A refresh rate of 120Hz n a Touch sampling rate up to 480Hz is the Best. But no IP certification. Doesn't know how much water n fall proof it is? Finger scanner is of very low quality.I have always used the Samsung Galaxy S series Top end phone but I thought to Try MI n my feeling is OK. Next time again it's a Samsung S Series just cause I am missing the Samsung UI and bixby voice command not the performance. Thanks to Microsoft Launcher that made this Messy UI a nice one. Must install Microsoft Launcher.Performance-wise this phone is a Rocket. My very personal opinion.",

Cameras are quite average.Sound is good.Display is good too but somehow it feels lacking. I dont know why.Battery is a huge redflag. Drains quite a lot.Save your money, buy another phone from another brand. 63k rupees not worth it AT ALL.",

    "Comment": "Good Phone but not as per expectation generated in product launch presentation",
    "Review": "1) Display : Display is great, but if you place side by side two phones with Full HD+ amoled screen, you can't distinguish between 2k display of this phone and Full HD+ display of similar phones in this price range. Similarly it's hard to distinguish between 10 bit display of this phone and 8 bit display of other phone. Also the display is mildly curved. It's not as much curved like Vivo or Motorola curved display phones2) Stereo Speakers : The expectation from the speakers are huge as the phone is having quad speakers tuned by Harmon Kardon. But the phone doesn't stand up to the expectations. The sound output is not loud. It's sound similar to other stereo speakers in this same price category. Sound output is good but not as per expectation considering quad speakers and Harmon Kardon branding3) Camera : Camera output is very good, particularly if shoot my the main lens. Low light photos are also brilliant. It would have been better if 3x optical zoom is provided in telephoto lens. I didn't experience and fog issue in camera lens so far.4) Battery : Battery back up is little low. You have to charge the phone in the evening with moderate usage like attending calls, surfing internet, social media, watching YouTube, watching videos. But it make up the battery back up with amazing fast charging even without Boost mode.5) Heating : I didn't face any heating issues while watching movies, browsing, using camera, watching YouTube. I didn't play any games.6) Software Updates: Though Xiaomi promises 4 years Security updates and 3 years Android updates, still the phone is running with July 2022 security patch as on 06/10/22. Also you will receive app download recommendations. Even after disabling the add notifications.7) Network reception : Though the phone support carrier aggregation, I didn't experience it with Airtel and Jio SIM. Network signal is okay but not that great. In low signal area you will face difficulties to connect but other phones in this price range, signal reception strength is little higher.",

    "Review": "Last 3 devices i used are Xiaomi phones so I bought Mi 12 Pro from mi(dot)com very 1st day. This is my 1st ever flagship phone. Hoping this will be a awesome product for the price but frankly saying I'm bit disappointed with Mi 12 Pro. Battery life is awful. I'm a casual user didn't play games a lot (may be maximum of 2hrs a week) yet the phone only gives me around 3hrs of screen on time (YouTube, Browsing, sometime what's app etc) even with 1080p resolution. I don't know how much battery gonna last if i used it in 2k resolution. Mobile data drains battery a lot. Battery drained 10+% if i turn on WIFI during sleep. So i decided to turn it off. Charging speed is actually awesome. It can charged the phone from 10% to 100% in 28-30 mins during my test. Even though they claimed full charge in 18mins if we turn on boost charge but i didn't try that. Sometime I'm having heating issues in a normal usage, not too hot but we can feel it. They are blabbing about the cooling tech they used but i don't know if it's useful at all. Camera and Display are good, Fingerprint Scanner is slow. Side or rear scanner can unlock the phone faster than this one. I will come back and update the review if the battery life improved in future update. I'm not a big fan of iPhones because of the higher price but after using this i think i should picked iPhone 12 for almost the same price.",

    "Review": "I have seen a lot of reviews where some of them are having battery issues- tbh when I started using this phone the first 2-3 days I did not get a good backup hardly I had 4-4:30 hrs of onscreen time then I changed my display settings to fhd and refresh rate to default, honestly the WQHD display is too good and it consumes more battery but for me FHD did the job and also increased the battery life to almost 6hrs on screen time. Apart from the battery problem I faced another issue that was heating, the phone would heat a lot while charging (obviously 120w is no joke) then I turned the boost mode off which reduces the heating (honestly the boosting option doesn't make much of difference in charging speed but definitely heats more so I would prefer it turned off) the phone charges from 10-100% within 30 mins without using it while charging. The phone slightly gets warm when on medium usage (it is because of the sd 8 Gen 1 processor which has throttling issues on all devices so the problem is not with Xiaomi it's with the processor so you can definitely go for devices with SD 8+ gen 1 ) The cameras are really good and night photography is to another level. The display is top notch and fingerprint reader is aslo fast. One more thing is that due to curve display the tempered glass is not available easily and the once with uv glue are difficult to install by yourself and are expensive, also there are not much varieties for cases. I got this phone for sale and after exchange got it for 36k so if you are thinking to buy then buy it during sale as for 63-69k you can go for iphone 13 if u are iOS fan or the s22 +",

    "Review": "A Good Phone for Media LoversBuild Quality:Awesome, very strong and premium build quality, not a fingerprint magnite and looking absolutely premium for sure for your bucks.Call Quality:The very first basic requirement of phone is call and cellular quality. Earpiece quality during the calls are loud and clear.Loudspeaker is very good for calls. Cellular reception was good for my both Jio and Airtel sims. I am happy with cellular call quality, it met with my one of major requirement.Screen:Superb and bright QuadHd Screen, picture and video quality is very good and crisp. This phone is Definitely for media lovers.Audio:I really like the audio output from speakers, earphone & wireless earphones. No issues on connectivity and music separation is also very good.Battery:I heard so many comments on battery...but for its ok...not worst or near to worst catagory. The standby time is good - took only 1% for 7 hours (screenshot attached).I removed background running access to unnecessary apps like Zomato or Swigy...etc which are required when we ordered food or when it needed. and removed unnecessary apps from auto launch.Yes, we can expect some fix from Xiaomi on battery but so far so good for me my usage.I haven't tried 120 watts charging speed but relatively it is quick for normal charging as well. which is fine for daily work life.Bloatware:Obviously i researched so many phones...i ended with Xiomi or Moto. I am non-bloatware lover. I love my phone to be filled with my choice of apps.Moto is my first choice for clean and non-bloatware apps but i needed dual apps feature for my second sim....and when its compare with Realme, iQooo, Samsung..etc.the bloatware installed in this phone is very very less..which is strange for me too. Thats the reason i choosen Xiomi.Camera:I enjoyed camera quality with this, taken few snaps of my family and friends. Really good. I haven\u2019t taken video but tried video as test which is also very good.Heating:For normal daily usage like calls, media, music, camera\u2026etc I haven\u2019t noticed any heat issues. While playing COD a bit bump in temperature for long play\u2026which is normal for any phone I guess.Chipset:Flagship processor 8 Gen 1, so no issues on usage.Verdict:If you are a media lover for more content viewer and music listener\u2026etc this is good phone.I admit that iphone 12 coming in near this price (exclude / include discounts) but I am media lover so I need big screen and I hate that big iphone notch (for the premium price). Secondly, I need physical dual sim instead eSim, dual app feature and speedy 120 hz screen.Overall MIUI 13 optimized and 99% mostly no errors found but\u00a0 request their team to speedup on battery thing which is fine for me but some people crying and dying for that. This is not paid or youtuber review\u2026I purchased personally with my hard earned money.Thank you for reading.",

    "Comment": "Perfect for me.. but there are cons which could be super serious for some",
    "Review": "Amazing phone but people im gonna share some negative points. So, if they're important you can avoid it.Let's go with cons first:1) Worst Selfie camera.. I'd have not said worst but my sister uses Vivo v17 pro and that phone with snapdragon 675 processor which is a 3 year old but still beats this phone's selfie camera hand down. There's no detail in facial hair. For me selfie camera is not a big deal. So yeah I'm very happy with the rear cameras..2) Most reviewers said it is giving an average of 5 hours of SoT but i used to for straight 3 hours and 4 mind and battery died, very very very very poor battery, I turned off quad HD and shifted to 1080p display for battery backup and more i get 4 and half to 5 hours but on the other side 120watt they makes up for it.3) one of the best if not the best haptics but the problem with the new flagship haptic motors is that you can't feel the vibration when it's in your jeans, that's a common issue with almost with all the flagships out there but maa kasam what a cool vibrations integrated inside the entire UI.4) i was confused for certain period that it was not going to 1hz as it is a LPTO 2.0 display with adaptive technology which go 1hz to 120hz no matter what you do it will never go to 1hz. Always on 10hz you can check it for urself. Yeah Xiaomi says it's a version 2.0 but I'm not sure why it doesn't go so easy to 1hz5) no custom launcher could be used with navigation gestures6) never ever try to record slow motion for more than 3-4minutes because it will fog up the camera lens bcoz of the heating7) Heating, yeah it does heat but it's normal as of now maybe the people who bought it in May could say how warm it goes but for me it always feel Lil warm that's it.8) yeaah the back design kind of fades away after initial impression.. it doesn't feel like flagship design anymore. And opera mauve is amazing color in hand not at all pinkish purplish. Black is dull but most people will go for that model only.9) main thing is i really don't want gorilla glass victus, it's a shady  protection u don't know how durable it is but it gets minor scratches very easily just with scrolling and all, I don't how my device got 4-5 scratches but it is definately not because of keys or coins or placing the phone with display down.10) if u don't insert the sim tray properly, the device automatically reboots i don't understand at all, even after installing it properly it went onto reboot until a 250mb ota which came last weekPros:Get the phone guys..1) They say it's not the best speaker, but i day it is.2) They say it's one of the best display but i say it is the best display.3) They say curved display has accidental unwanted touches, i say go into the UI and goto additional settings and select ignore accidental touches on the edge option and customise to your preferred width and there you go. And to my surprise It works 99 times it of 100 and that for me is a great thing rather than using a boring normal flat display phones.",

    "Review": "Just upgraded from 11T pro & got this phone 2 days back. Here's my experience:This phone has Super specs at this price.Snadragon 8 Gen phone with 3 50 MP cameras is just too good at this price.The phones looks really good... i mean really really good. So many people have asked me which device this isThe Opera Mauve color (premium Pink finish) is something that I have never seen before. Xoami has nailed the looksI have used Camera to click some casual pics.. and the photos are stunning. It looks like its shot by a pro photo-grapher. The colors look natural, and very real life like.I mostly use the phone for basic apps, camera and gaming. Overall the UI exprience is very smooth. dint experience lag while playing games.... One thing that i normally don't pay attention to is sound. but, this phone has much superio audio quality you can't ignore. quad speaker setup is amazing.It comes with a 120W charge - which am also using to charge my Mac and ipad too. Apple original charger would have easily costed 5k INR, and it isn't as fast.Final comment:If you are looking for a premium looking device with best camera experience, and performance - this device is undoubtedly the best.120W USB C charger is a big plus.",

    "Review": "After two weeks of extensive research of different makes of mobile phones though several online reviews, studying technical specs, cost etc. I have decided to fix Xiaomi 12 Pro Global version. Excellent display, breathtaking very fast charging time, stunning photos and videos, smooth OS Android 12 & MIUI Global13. No heating problem at all.RAM is showing 8GB+3GB.I like the Second Home screen feature, Eye tracking, movement tracking and display screen (using Lens feature).I have changed my mind from iPhone Promax 13 & Oneplus  10 Pro to Xiaomi 12 Pro.I will update after a few weeks of usage",

When they are asking for such a huge price, it's not just the processor or ram that is important. It is the flagship build quality and quality of the phone. Both 1+ 10 Pro and this one feels terribly cheap and I feel that I wasted my hard earned money on them. These Chinese phones are no longer offering VFM options. Better to put extra and get Samsung Flagships.",
